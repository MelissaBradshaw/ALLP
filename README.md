# The Amy Lowell Letters Project

_The Amy Lowell Letters Project is an open-access, digital scholarly edition of the letters of American poet, editor, and critic Amy Lowell (1874–1925)._

_Lowell's letters show her talking to—sometimes arguing with—the most prominent writers and publishers of her time. Earnest, often funny, and bristling with provocations, they illuminate the many roles she played in the stormy creation and promotion of modernist poetics. They reveal, as well, the labor behind modern poetry as we understand it today: the queries, submissions, revisions, rejections, referrals, introductions, invitations, disagreements, collaborations, and financial transactions that bridge artistic creation and public consumption._
