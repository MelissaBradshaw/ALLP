# Site Index

Every key ID will link to an entry in our Site Index. Ultimately, the Site Index will consist of the following -ographies:
1. **[Personography](https://github.com/MelissaBradshaw/ALLP/blob/master/siteIndex/allpPersonography.xml)** (people)
2. **Placeography** (places)
3. **Orgography** (organizations, incl. publishers and groups of people ("the Aldingtons"))
4. **Bibliography** (publications, including journals/periodicals, monographs, articles, and poems)
5. **Theme-ography** (project-specific themes)
6. **Event-ography:** _TBD_

### Items Without Key IDs:
If an encoder encounters an item without a key ID in the Site Index, they should add an entry to the “Possible Additions” sheet on the [ALLP Site Index – Master List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rEoXpOInaGy10lafFUBpuPteD76ZmhdpADFOtIoyk-M/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet. Suggestions will be reviewed by the editor, and added to the Site Index accordingly.
