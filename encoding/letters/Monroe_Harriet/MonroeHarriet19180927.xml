            <p> 
Thank you very much for the little joke, which I enjoyed immensely. I wonder who the anonymous English authors are who sent it to you. As to the re-printing of <title key="appuldurcombePark" level="a">“Appuldurcombe Park”</title> in <title key="theEveningJournal" level="j">“The Evening Journal,”</title> I am very much pleased to think that they felt like doing it. From what you say, I suppose it is your friend, <persName key="helen_birch">Miss Birch</persName>, who is responsible. <persName key="wc_williams">William Carlos Williams</persName> wrote me a most enthusiastic letter about it, at which I was greatly  astonished. Altogether, it  seems to be doing well.
I trust you got my book safely which I sent you the other day. I know you are not stuck on <rs key="polyProse" type="style">polyphonic prose</rs>, but I trust that there is something  in it which you will like. You will probably have received the advertisement  by now, because it was in the list of advertisements which <orgName key="macmillan">Macmillan</orgName> sent me the other day.
I am still stuck to my bed, but your having told me not to worry about that makes the sticking less undesirable. As I feel perfectly well, it is annoying, but the doctor assures me that when he does let me up, I will be entirely well. At any rate, he found that the operation was much more necessary than they had anticipated. I was on the operating table one hour and twenty minutes, therefore, I am reconciled, although, I confess, I find this enforced illness a bit trying.
  <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
