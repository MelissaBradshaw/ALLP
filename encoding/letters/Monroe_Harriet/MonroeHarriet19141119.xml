                <p>Thank you very much for your &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; of <title key="coalPicker" level="a">&quot;The Coal Picker.&quot;</title> I had no idea it was due for any such distinction.</p>
                <p>I have written a review of <title key="youAndI" level="m">you</title><!-- I was unsure of where to apply the tag, Lowell is referring to Monroe's book You and I here - blw --> for the <title key="bostonHerald" level="j">&quot;Herald&quot;</title> which I think will come out in a week or two. I think you will like it. I have tried to make it sound like a criticism and not an appreciation merely. It is unsigned because they do not allow signed articles in the &quot;Herald.&quot; I feel quite sure that you will like it and it is all quite true.</p>
                <p>Will you be so kind as to send me a copy of <persName key="dh_lawrence">D. H. Lawrence&apos;s</persName> <title key="balladOfAnotherOphelia">&quot;A Ballad of Another Ophelia.&quot;</title> It is to be included in <title key="some_imagist_poets" level="m">our anthology</title> by you so he could not even send it to me to be included in the manuscript of the book submitted to the publishers.</p>
                <p>I am assuming that we have your permission to reprint such poems in the anthology, as you have published, making the usual acknowledgement. It will not appear until <date when="1915">late spring</date>, of course, if then.</p>
