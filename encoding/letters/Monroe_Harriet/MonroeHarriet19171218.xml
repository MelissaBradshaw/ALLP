                <p> This is the proof. There would not be nearly so many alterations if you would stick more closely to my text, which, 
                    as I have frequently told you, I prepare with great care. For instance, you have stanza spaces throughout the poem where none existed. I have decided to accept 
                    three of these; the others must go. You are quite right about “heeded”. It was a misprint in the manuscript. 
                    Some of your other suggestions  I have taken, but in most instances I prefer my original method. At any rate, this proof is now correct.</p>
                <p> I am awfully sorry to have held you up on it, but I do wish in future you could arrange to send me your proofs with a little more leeway, 
                    so that they may be properly done. It seems to me that I am always telegraphing my corrections, and I am sure that that (sic) is quite unnecessary. 
                    Of course usually I can send the proof back by return mail. Unfortunately this time I was away from <placeName key="brookline">home,</placeName> and sending it 
                    to me and my getting back to where there was a manuscript has made a delay of exactly three days. Had I had a week or so leeway there three days 
                    would not have made any difference to you nor to me.</p> 
                <P> However, here it is rushed off for the mail, and I hope it will come in time. I will not stop to write a letter with it now.</p>
                <closer> Sincerely yours,</closer>
