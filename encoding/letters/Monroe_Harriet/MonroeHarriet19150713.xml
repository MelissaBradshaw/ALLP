                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener>
                <p>I am very glad that you are giving me <date when="1915-09">September</date>. Please lead off with <title key="leadSoldiers">“Lead Soldiers,”</title> as
                it is much the best poem you have got.</p>
                <p>So far as I know, there is no truth in the rumour that I am to be poetry editor of <title key="newRepublic" level="j">“The New
                    Republic.”</title> Nobody has approached me on the subject, and so far as I know several of the editors
                of “The New Republic” are not particularly crazy about the new types of poetry; so I should
                think it very unlikely that they would smile upon my appointment. It is a job I should like
                extremely, but I cannot think it would come my way. Thank you for your good word with
                <persName key="francis_hackett">Francis Hackett</persName>. He is a queer creature, and I suspect that forgetting appointments is a habit with
                him, as I have known him to do it before. I quite agree with you in what you say about “The New
                Republic,” but we must not forget that the men in charge of it are chiefly interested in politics
                and, although they try to keep up the other side as well, they started t<pb n="02">he review to air their
                political views. They have asked me to write them an article on <title key="newMannerInModernPoetry">“The New Manner in Modern
                    Poetry,”</title> which of course I shall do; and they have accepted two poems of mine, but I have no
                idea when they are going to publish them.</p>
                <p>We are still in <placeName key="brookline">Brookline</placeName>, because my friend <persName key="ada_russell">Mrs. Russell</persName> is not at all well. What are you
                going to do for the <date when="1915">summer</date>?</p>
                <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
