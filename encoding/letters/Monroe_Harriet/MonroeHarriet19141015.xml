                    <p>A disagreeable thought has come into my mind, and I think it always better to say things right out when you feel them<add place="inline" type="insertion" rend="pencil">,</add><!--The addition was not in the original transcription - blw--> so you will pardon me if I tell you that I fear it is because of the number of pages which the two poems would take<add place="inline" type="insertion" rend="pencil">,</add><!--The addition was not in the original transcription - blw--> and the consequent size of the check which you would have to pay me<add place="inline" type="insertion" rend="pencil">,</add><!--The addition was not in the original transcription - blw--> which has determined your decision.

                    <p><del rend="strikethrough">It seems to me that the</del><add place="above" type="insertion" rend="pencil">Surely a</add><!--The deletion was not in the original transcription - blw--> labourer is worthy of his hire.

Your<add place="above" type="insertion" rend="pencil">s</add><!--The addition was not in the original transcription - blw--> will not be the first <title key="poetry">magazine</title> which has tried to dock my pay. I only ask what everyone asks, to be taken on my own merits regardless of my surroundings. It is a position you would not deny the beggar. I wish I could see so honest a democratic spirit in the world that they would not deny it to the man with enough means to live <add place="above" type="insertion" rend="pencil">up</add>on.<!--The addition was not in the original transcription - blw--></p>
                <p>I know <title key="bombardment">&quot;The Bombardment&quot;</title> to be the best poem of the two and therefore I can conceive no reason why you should refuse to take it in except lack of space. In your original advertisement you agreed sometimes to give one poet the whole number.

                <p>If I am wrong in my suspicions I beg you to forgive me, but indeed you have no idea how difficult it is to be treated fairly when people know that you are not living on what you earn.</p>
