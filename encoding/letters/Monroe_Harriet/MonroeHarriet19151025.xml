                        <p>This letter is three pages long. On the first page, the words “Poetry Monroe” are written in pencil at the top. 
                            The third page also has, typed, H.M. in the top left corner, and the date (10/25/15) in the top right corner, as 
                            well as a -2- in the middle. There is also a black dot on each page near the bottom that looks like it could be 
                            from a hole punch.</p>

                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet:</persName></salute></opener>
                <p> I did not for a moment wish to force myself upon your notice for an honorable mention. It never occurred to me that 
                    I could influence your judgment; in fact, I know perfectly well that I could not, and so do you. I merely thought it would 
                    be an agreeable way of getting out of the difficulty for me, and spoke of it accordingly. One of the things I have always 
                    so greatly admired about you is that you &quote;gang your ane gait&quote; quite regardless of suggestions. So if you do not feel like 
                    giving me an honorable mention, why do not do it, my Dear, that is all. </p>
                <p> <persName key="ac_henderson">Alice Henderson</persName> writes me that she will be here <date when="1915-10-25">to-day</date> or 
                    <date when="1915-10-26">to-morrow,</date>  and I shall be very glad indeed to see her. I am anxiously awaiting a telephone from her 
                    to say that she has reached the town.</p>
                <p> <persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher</persName> has got here, as you know. He came out to see me last <!-- Last is cut out by a punch hole-->night, and among other things told 
                    me that <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName> had [sentence cut off] [given you a copy] 
                <pb="n2">
                    of <persName key="remy_gourmont">Remy de Courmont &aphos;s</persName> <title key="saintsParadise" level="m">&quote;aints of Paradise,&quote;</title> 
                    telling you it was an authorized translation. I have not the slightest doubt that De Gourmont authorized <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName> to translate it, 
                    but here is an awkward position. <persName key="alfred_valette">Alfred Vallette,</persName> 
                    who is as you know editor and manager of the <title key="mercureDeFrance" level="j"><u>Mercure de France</u></title>, 
                    gave <orgName key="macmillan">Macmillan</orgName> permission <date when="1915">last Sprint</date> for me to use anything I pleased from any 
                    of their publications in my forthcoming  book <title key="sixFrechPoets">&quote;Six French Poets.&quote;</title> Now I have quoted the Dedication 
                    of the &quote;Saints of Paradise&quote; and the poems of four of the saints: Agatha, Colette, Jeanne d&aphos;Arc, and Ursula, in my text in French and 
                    translated them with all the other translations in an appendix. I think you should know this. It may not in the least interfere  with your accepting <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard&aphos;s</persName> 
                    translation; and I do not in the least want it to; 
                    only as my book will be out within two weeks or so, it will prevent <title key="poetry" level="j">&quote;Poetry&quote;</title> from having the first 
                    translation.</p>
                <p> I have had a long struggle in my own mind between my loyalty to Richard in keeping still and letting his translation go through, 
                    and 
               <pb="n3">
                    you were not getting exactly what you thought. Richard does not, of course, know what poems I am translating, so this idea of 
                    our clashing naturally never entered his head. And please remember, if you do accept Richard&aphos;s translations, that 
                    I do not mind at all.</p>
                <p> I doubt very much whether Remy de Gourmont possessed the right to authorize translations. He was, I think, 
                    a member of the <u>Mercure de France Company; but I know 
                    that Macmillian wrote to <persName key="alfred_valette">Vallette</persName> rather than to him, although I was in communication with De Gourmont 
                    during the time and he himself sent him his portrait for reproduction. Of course, the &quote;Saints of Paradise&quote; is not a very new book, 
                    as it was originally published in 1898, and reprinted in <title key="divertissements" level="j"><u>Divertissement [s]</u></title> in 1914.</p>
