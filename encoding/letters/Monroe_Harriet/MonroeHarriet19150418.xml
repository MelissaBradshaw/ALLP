                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>-</salute></opener>
                <p>I am delighted with what you have done for me in the <title key="poetry" level="j">April number</title>. Many thanks!
                    <persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher’s</persName> article is certainly most handsome, &amp; I think my poems look very well- It is a good
                    number. <persName key="rupert_brooke">Rupert Brooke’s</persName> sonnets are high-minded, &amp; serious, &amp; thoroughly English<!--crossed out English and wrote French-->. I think the
                    dignity &amp; sorrow of a real experience may make an excellent poet of him. Technique he always
                    had, but he needed reality. Those little <persName key="p_column">Padraic Column</persName> Poems, particularly the coal carts are
                very good. I think <title key="orchestra">“The Orchestra”</title> is one of <persName key="ww_gibson">Gibson’s</persName> best, &amp; certainly <title key="blackbird">“The Blackbird”</title> is the
                    best poem of <persName key="ridgley_torrence">Torrence’s</persName> I have seen</p>
                <p>I am sending you a presentation copy of our <title key="some_imagist_poets" level="m">Anthology</title>. Of course you will get one in the
                ordinary course of business, but I want you to have one from me. In reviewing it, please don’t
                lay stress on the schism with <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra</persName>. I don’t want to make the row important. Rows are a mistake,
                &amp; their perpetuation shall be none of my doing- Do you know, my Dear, I have had occasion to
                go over all the numbers of Poetry since its beginning, in connection with a talk on <title key="newMannerInModernPoetry">“The New
                    Manner in Modern Poetry”</title> I gave at the <orgName key="roundTableClub">“Round Table Club,”</orgName> &amp; I was immensely struck by the
                fact that <pb n="02">there is not a single poet of distinction among the younger generation whom you have
                not printed.</p>
                <p>Go on, my Child, never mind any of us when we criticise, taken in its entirety your
                review is a magnificent achievement. And the impartiality with which you represent all schools
                is fine. Now I have a suggestion to make. You will remember that you still have six little poems
                of mine, &amp; that you were going to lead off with me sometime. Now these six are not enough,
                either in size or importance to go alone. Will you take <title key="leadSoldiers">“Lead Soldiers”</title> to preceed them? It is the
                best thing I have done, I am sure. You remember you liked it but I wanted to try <title key="newRepublic" level="j">“The New
                Republic”</title> people with it. Of course it was way off from their taste, &amp; the six gentlemen who
                vote upon the poetry there, turned it down. So it is at your disposal, &amp; I suggest that you take it,
                &amp; let it preceed the six poems you have, &amp; open with the collection about <date when="1915-08">August</date> or
                    <date when="1915-09">September.</date> Will you? If so I will send(sic) it right away.</p>
                <p>Did I tell you that <persName key="el_masters">Masters</persName> wrote me a very nice letter, some time ago- I thought it was
                very kind of him to write, those things help</p>
                <p>I am up to my eyes in work, for <orgName key="macmillan">Macmillan</orgName> has taken my french lectures, &amp; they all have
                to be re-written, as they were done to speak.</p>
                <p>Do take “Lead Soldiers”, it is good, I know</p>
                <closer><p>Affectionately yours.</p>
                <p>Amy Lowell.</p></closer>
