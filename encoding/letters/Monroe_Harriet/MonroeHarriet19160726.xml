                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener>
                <p>I have just this minute received your letter, forwarded from <placeName key="brookline">Brookline</placeName>.</p>
                <p>As to your suggestions for my contributions to the Anthology, I am quite satisfied with <title key="1777” level="a”>&quot;1777&quot;</title> for my second contribution (I certainly want <title key="patterns” level="a”>&quot;Patterns&quot;</title> for my first). If you do not care for &quot;1777&quot;, I would suggest that you quote <title key="malmaison” level="a”>&quot;Malmaison&quot;</title>, which appears in the current number of <title key="littleReview" level="j">&quot;The Little Review&quot;</title>. Personally I think it one of the very best things I have ever done, and <persName key="ec_marsh">Mr. Marsh</persName> thinks it the very best. It is in polyphonic prose, which I know you do not care for, and it is seven pages, which is exactly what &quot;1777&quot; is in my typewritten sheets. If, however, you prefer &quot;1777&quot; to &quot;Malmaison&quot;, I would keep it. I certainly do not want to get rid of &quot;1777&quot; for any of the other poems you suggest in its place.</p>
<p><title key="apology" level="a">&quot;Apology&quot;</title> is a little out of key, I think, but it is a good poem of its kind, and people like it. And I think if you put it at the very end of the group it will not clash, as it does in the middle.</p>
<p>The poem here which I care least about it <title key="painterOnSilk" level="a">&quot;The Painter on Silk&quot;</title>. If you care to substitute for that either <title key="theCapturedGoddess" level="a">&quot;The Captured Goddess&quot;</title> or <title key="chinoiseries" level="a">&quot;Chinoiseries&quot;</title> — which is in the current number of <title key="others">“Others”</title>, I should prefer it. I do not suggest <title key="clearWithLightVariableWinds" level="a">&quot;Clear, With Light Variable Winds&quot;</title> in that place, as I think it has a certain resemblance to <title key="paterns" level="a">&quot;Patterns&quot;</title>; and I think either &quot;The Captured Goddess&quot; or &quot;Chinoiseries&quot; would be better. My group in that case will stand:</p>
                        <list>Patterns
                        1777 or Malmaison
                        <title key= "venusTransiens" level="a">Venus Transiens</title>
                        <pb n="2">
                        <title key="aLady” level="a”>A Lady</title>
                        The Painter On Silk — or The Captured Goddess, or Chinoiseries
                        <title key="solitaire” level="a”>Solitaire</title>
                        <title key="aGift” level="a”>A Gift</title>
                        <title key="redSlippers” level="a">Red Slippers</title>
                        Apology</list>
<p>&quot;Apology&quot; by all means last.</p>
<p>This suits me perfectly, and I leave you to choose which of the alternatives you will take, always provided you take these and no others.</p>
                            <p>I enclose my article on <persName key="mary_aldis">Mrs. Aldis&apos;s</persName> <title key="flashlights" level="m">&quot;Flashlights&quot;</title>, which I trust is short enough for you. If not, send it back, and I will shorten it. But as you always put quotations in smaller prints, I think it will come in the space you want.</p>
<p>When is the Anthology coming out — <date when="1916">this Autumn</date>?</p>
                <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
