                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet:</persName></salute></opener>
                <p> Your letter of <date when="1916-02-25">February 25th</date> came this morning. <measure type="currency" num="60">$60.00</measure> will 
                    be all right for “&quote;Off the Turnpike.
                    I see your point about bargain rates, and what you offer will be all right.</p>
                <p> I saw in <title key="newYorkTimes" level="j">&quote;The Times&quote;</title> yesterday that 
                    your &quot;Anthology&quote; was coming out next Wednesday, but I imagine from your letter that it 
                    cannot be coming so soon. I think myself that <title key="patterns" level="a">&quot;Patterns&quot;</title> 
                    and <title key="redSlippers" level="a">&quot;Red Slippers&quot;</title> would be better for me 
                    than <title key="coalPicker" level="a">&quot;The Coal Picker&quot;</title> and <title key="aBlockhead" level="a">&quot;The Blockhead&quot;</title>
                    &ndash; I really don&apos;t want &quot;The Blockhead&quot;, a I wrote you; and although I like &quot;The Coal Picker&quot; well enough, 
                    still I think the other two would be better. Of course, I understand that you cannot arrange exactly; but I should like to think
                    these two to go in, as long as you do not want <title key="leadSoldiers">&quot;Lead Soldiers&quot;</title>.</p>
                <p> We have given you a fine send-off in &quot;<title key="some_imagist_poets" level="m">Some Imagist Poets</title> 1916&quot; &ndash; 
                    not in the &quot;Preface&quot;, but in the acknowledgements. It did not go well in the &quot;Preface&quot;, as the &quot;Preface&quot;
                    was entirely taken up with matters of technical discussion. But we have given you a whole sentence, and have said how you were the first 
                    person to publish imagist poems, how you discovered and have ever since encouraged Imagist poets.</p>
                <p> I am glad you liked my article in <title key="poetryJournal" level="j">&quot;The Poetry Journal. </title>
                    See you soon now, and please put those two I have 
                <pb="n2">    
                    mentioned in your &quot;Anthology&quot;, no matter what else you leave out.  
                </p>
