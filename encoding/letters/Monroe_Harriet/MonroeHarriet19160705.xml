                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet:</persName>:</salute></opener> 
                <p>Your letter came this morning. I have not a copy of <title key="1777" level= "a">“1777,”</title> but I will have one made for you at once and send it within a day or two.</p>
                <p>Would you like me to review <persName key="mary_aldis">Mrs. Aldis’s</persName> <title key="flashlights" level= "m">“Flashlights”</title> for your <title key= "poetry" level ="j">September number</title>? If you would, say so. I should like to show her this courtesy, as she has been so very nice to me.</p>
                <p>Now I am going to ask you to do me a favour. Will you find out if <persName key="margaret_anderson">Margaret Anderson</persName> is in town? And if possible will you communicate with her, and find out if she had some letters and a poem from me? I sent her a poem by which I take great store, which I wanted to come out before the publications of my book. I have heard nothing from her about it, and I sent it about a <date when="1916-06"> month ago </date>. Ten days or so ago, I wrote again, asking if she had received it. To neither of these letters have I had the slightest reply. I do not know if she is hiding from duns, or what is the matter; but even so, I can hardly imagine her not answering if she got the things. I know there must be some mishap somewhere, as she is a perfect angel about my work. If she is in straits, I should like to know it. So would it bother you awfully to let your secretary or somebody look her up? <persName key="maxwell_bodenheim">Bodenheim</persName> had a tale that she was going to <placeName key="california">California</placeName>for the Summer, but the last letter I had from her said nothing about it. Anyhow, I want to know where my poem is, and I shall be deeply obliged to you if you will do this for me. </p>
               
                <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
