                        <p>This letter is two pages long. The word “Poetry” is handwritten in pencil on the top of the page, with the name “Monroe” handwritten above the start of the typed text. The number 21 is written in pencil on the top right corner and circled. There is also the number 17 written and circled in the bottom left corner of the page. For the date of the letter, there is what looks like a 7 penciled in over erased text. It is unclear whether this letter was written on the 21 of November or the 27, but the date may have been changed due to the addition of the P.S. at the end of the letter.</p>

                <p>I have received <persName key="dh_lawrence">Lawrence&apos;s</persName> <title key="balladOfAnotherOphelia" level="a">&quot;Ophelia.&quot;</title> I disagree with you. I think it is one of the very best things he has done, and I agree with him that the first part could not possibly be separated from the second. I think you made a mistake not to take it. I think it is full of imagination and feeling and absolutely original.</p>
                <p>The <persName>editor</persName><!-- not sure who the editor is - blw--> of the <title level="j">&quot;Herald&quot;</title> <!-- not sure which herald - blw --> tells me that he must shorten my review of <title key="youAndI" level="m">your book</title> which is very annoying to me because I thought I had got it within the length he allowed. I begged him to send it back to me and let me shorten it myself, but he said no, it was quite easy to do it. In case he curtails it very much I will send you a copy of what I originally wrote at the same time I send you the clipping. I rather imagine it will come out <date>next Saturday</date>, namely <date>tomorrow</date>.<!--Dates are currently unclear, the letter has "27" written over the "21" in the dateline - blw--> I will hold over this letter and see whether I can enclose it.</p>
