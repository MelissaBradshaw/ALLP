               <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener>
           <p>Thank you very much for your review in <title key="poetry" level="j">“Poetry.”</title> I am kind of sorry that you put in that about learning, as above all things I don’t want people to get into their heads that I am academic and dry. And I know you did not mean to convey that impression; I only feel that perhaps it may a little. </p>
<p>But I am sorry you do not like my longer poems. It is very funny—reviewers seem equally divided between those who love them and those who detest them. It was very handsome indeed of you to say what you did about my <title key="vers libre" level="a">vers libre,</title> and altogether I am exceedingly obliged to you for putting it in so soon and for giving me such a nice sendoff.</p>
<p><persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher</persName> will be in <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName> soon. He is a dear boy when you know him well, and I think you will enjoy seeing him very much. I am giving him a letter to <persName key="margaret_anderson">Miss Anderson</persName>. I don’t know whether I told you that <orgName key="houghton_mifflin">Houghton, Mifflin & Company</orgName> is issuing his <title key="irradiations" level="m">“Irradiations”</title> in book form.</p>
<p>I am longing to see the <persName key="lawrence">Lawrence</persName> war poem. He wrote me about it.</p>
<p>I find I am obliged to put off my visit to Chicago until after Christmas, which is too bad, but the work is so pressing here that I cannot get away before.</p>
<p>With all sorts of good wishes for your Christmas,</p>

            <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
