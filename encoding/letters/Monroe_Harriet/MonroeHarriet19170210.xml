              <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener> 
            <p>Of course, I quite understand that once a year is as much as anybody can appear on your front page, and I realize that the last time you put me there was in <date when="1916-08">August,</date> when you printed <title key="1777" level="a">“1777”</title> as your opening poem. I rather suppose that you would count this for the following year, but I am perfectly willing to have you put it at the end, and we will call my next contribution, whenever that may be, the opening one.</p>
            <p>Six pages will be ample, and I am quite willing to leave to you the selection of the poems — although I think perhaps the short ones that the more striking, with the exception of the adaptation from <persName key ="yakura_sanjin">Yakura Sanjin,</persName> which I personally think very lovely (and I can say that, as I am not responsible for it). However, as I say, you shall do exactly as you please about this group.</p>
            <p>The lady who sent you <measure type="currency" num ="200">two hundred dollars</measure> certainly deserves a vote of thanks from all of us.</p>
            <p>I will appear at <placeName key="little_theatre">The Little Theatre</placeName> at 4.30, on <date when="1917-02-25">Sunday, February 25th.</date> I am planning merely to read my poems, with just a few words of explanation where that seems necessary, but as few as possible. In other words, I consider this a reading, not a lecture, which is what I think you want.</p>
            <p>I am looking forward to being in <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName> once more and seeing you.</p>
         <closer>Affectinately yours,</closer>
