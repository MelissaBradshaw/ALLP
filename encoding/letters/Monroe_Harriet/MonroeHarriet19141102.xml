                <p>Thank you very much for the check. I think it is a little hard that I have to pay for the setting up of <title key="allies" level="a">&quot;The Allies&quot;</title> when I told you all along that I wanted <title key="bombardment" level="a">&quot;The Bombardment&quot;</title> but if you feel it that way I can only bow to your decision.</p>
                <p>I have been having an awful time with <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra</persName> on account of a serious blunder of <orgName key="macmillan">Macmillan&apos;s</orgName> in the advertisement of <title key="swordBladesAndPoppySeeds" level="m">my book</title>. As soon as I say it I knew what trouble it would cause and cabled my regrets, but Ezra has taken it as a personal insult and has written a most abominable letter to Macmillan and a most disagreeable one to me. I wish to Heaven my publishers had not seen fit to advertise me as an imagiste, particularly as I have said in my preface that I did not belong to any school.</p>
                <p>It is most annoying and added to an attack of ptomaine poisoning it makes me very blue. That <pb n="2">is why I telegraphed you to know if you could change the advertisement in the <date when="1914-11">November</date> number.  As you have not telegraphed the answer I suppose it is too late. </p>
                <p>I told Macmillan to put that advertisement of my book in <title key="poetry" level="j">&quot;Poetry&quot;</title> to give you another advertisement and if I had not been so kindly affectioned Ezra would never have seen it and all would have been well.</p>
                <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
