                    <physDesc> <p>This letter is three pages long. On the first page, the words “Poetry Monroe” are written 
                        in pencil at the top, and in bottom left there is a number 42 sorround by a circle in pencil.
                        The third page also has, typed, H.M. in the top left corner, and the date (9/30/15) 
                        in the top right corner, as well as a -2- in the middle. There is also a black dot on each page that looks like it 
                        could be from a hole punch. </p>

                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet:</persName></salute></opener>
                <p>I remember that this is about the time when you begin to choose your annual prize poem, and my recollection 
                    on the subject is farther confirmed by a letter from <persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher</persName> telling
                    me that you are already doing so. Do you think it would be asking too much if I suggested that you 
                    print somewhere in <title key="poetry" level="j">your magazine </title> that my poems are not submitted in 
                    competition for the prize? You see, no matter whether you like the poems or not, you would 
                    not consider me a suitable recipient for a cash donation; and in that I think you are quite right. But it 
                    is a little hard for me to realize that I shall be turned down for this prize indefinitely, year after year, 
                    not on the merits or demerits of the poems themselves, but for the contents of my bank book. Under these circumstances, 
                    would it not be fairer to me and put me in a better position with the public if you mention that I am not 
                    running in this competition? </p>
                <p>><add place="bottom"> I submit this for your judgment, and don&apos;t </add>
                <pb="n2">
                    like the idea. But I think it would be a good idea.</p>
                <p>Also I should be deeply grateful if you could honorably mention some of my numerous contributions to your magazine, 
                    as you did <tittle key="coalPicker" level="a">the &quote;Coal Picker&quote;</tittle> last year. Of the shorter 
                    poems I think <title key="venusTransiens" level="a">&quote;Venus Transiens&quote;</title> is the best you had. But I 
                    cannot help feeling that <title key="bombardment" level="a">the &qutoe;Bombardment&quote;</title> or <title key="leadSoldiers">&quote;Lead Soldiers&quote;</title> 
                    are seriously the better poems.</p>
                <p>By the way, did you see my little bouquet handed to you in my review of <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard&apos;s</persName> poetry 
                    in <title key="littleReview" level="j">“The Little Review?”</title></p>
                <p>I expect to have <title key="sixFrenchPoets" level="m">my book</title> out in about three weeks, and I am going to make <orgName key="macmillan">Macmillan</orgName> 
                    advertise it for two or three months in your paper, full page. I do not know whether you review books about poetry. If you do, I will send you some proof sheets, 
                    and I should be awfully grateful if you could review it in your November or December issue. </p>
                <P> Thank you for mentioning me in your <placeName key="sanFrancisco">San Francisco</placeName> interview. Every little helps, and I 
                <pb="n3">
                    for one am thoroughly discouraged and disgusted at the general situation; and you cannot think how a kind word helps. You know how it is yourself.</p>
      
                <closer> Affectionately yours,</closer>
