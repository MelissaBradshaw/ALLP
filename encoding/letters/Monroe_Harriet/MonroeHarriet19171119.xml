                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet:- </persName></salute></opener>
                <p>Your postal has come <date when="1917-11-19">to-day.</date> I thank you very much for telling me about 
                    the guarantors’ copies. I wonder whether you are still sending copies to <perName key="charles_perkins">Mrs. Charles B. Perkins,</perName> 
                    <place key="Boston">Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts,</place> and to Miss <persName key="annie_chapman">Annie Chapman,</persName> 
                    <placeName key="London">Poplars,Rickmansworth,Herts, England.</place> If not, I shall be very glad indeed if you would send copies to these people.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed <persName key="carl_sandburg">Sandburg’s</persName> war poem very much. I think perhaps it was a little uneven in spots, but I was very glad to 
                    have made way for anything so good.</p>
                <p>By the way I have had a somewhat unfortunate experience with that <persName key="pierre_deLanux">M. de Lanux</persName> whom I wrote about. He turned our to 
                    be rather a laze fellow, and I am happy to learn from <persName key="martyn_johnson">Martyn Johnson</persName> 
                    that <title key="dial" level="j">&quot;The Dial&quot;</title> has had the same difficulty  with him. I have, therefore, severed my connections with him. 
                    Th (sic) translation of his poems I have seen, and they do not strike me as good, but as I wrote you before the originals which I saw first are quite charming. 
                    I tell you all this in order that you may know how I stand in regard to him should he send you these poems. I know you would not take  them on my account unless 
                    you liked them, but still if you thought he were a friend of mine, you might be more inclined to loon upon his work with a favorable eye. I think his original 
                    verses alone, however, would repay you if you wish to publish them, but I would not touch the translations, if I were you. It is immaterial to me what you do 
                    as far as he is concerned.</p>
