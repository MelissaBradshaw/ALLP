                <salute>My dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Miss Monroe</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>I am enclosing all the poems which you chose, and also the little list of them which you
               made with your own handwriting, to prove their correctness.</p>
            <p>I also send back "<title key="coalPicker" level="a">The Coal Picker</title>," which I found among my things, just as you said, and
               "<title key="taleOfStarvation" level="a">A Tale of Starvation</title>," the latter being, as it were, on perpetual approval, and not, I understand,
               accepted, and you will take it or not, as you see fit.</p>
            <p>I had extremely good luck in <placeName key="nyc">New York</placeName>, you will be glad to know. My "<title key="hearingAWaltz" level="a">Waltz</title>" was
               taken by "<title key="international" key="j">The International</title>," and the "<title key="century">Century</title>" and "<orgName key="scribner">Scribner</orgName>" both have taken a number to
               consider, and <persName key="yard_robert">Mr. Yard</persName> of the Century, and <persName key="george_viereck">Mr. Varick</persName> <!-- spelled incorrectly --> of the International were both so
               complimentary that my h[sic] head is completely whirled round, and I feel that the only natural
               way for me to walk would be backward.
               I do hope that you can put my poems into the 
            <pb n="02"><title key="poetry" level="j"><date when="1914-04">April number</title></date>, as I am most anxious to have them appear.</p>
            <p>I have got two new subscribers for you. At least they promised me that they would
               subscribe, <persName key="carlotta_Lowell">Miss Carlotta Lowell</persName> of <placeName key="nyc">New York</placeName>, and <persName key="elizabeth_putnam">Miss Elizabeth Putnam</persName> of <placeName key="boston">Boston</placeName>, and I wish
               you could have heard me boom your magazine to all the people I met in New York. Don’t forget
               that I really mean what I say about reviewing books, and writing any other little articles you may
               happen to want. I should be perfectly happy to do anything I can. It is all grist to me, and you
               cannot think how much I have the welfare of your magazine at heart. The more I see of them in
               New York, editors and their pa[sic] papers, the more I realize that "<title key="poetry" level="j">Poetry</title>" has a field all to
               itself, and one which I believe to be of immense importance.</p>
