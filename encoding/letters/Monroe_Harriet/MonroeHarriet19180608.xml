            <p>I am ashamed to say that I forgot to sent this <measure type="currency" num="100">hundred dollars</measure> in March, which was when I believe it was due. I am awfully sorry, and I hope it has not inconvenienced you.</p>
            <p><persName key="florence_ayscough">Florence Ayascough</persName> tells me that you would like a series of combination Chinses poems, so she and I are going to set to work at once, and a bunch will arrive in due time.</p>
            <p>When are you going to print <title key="appuldercombePark" level="a">"Appuldercombe Park"</title>? You have not had anything of mine since January, and I think it is time you put that in - don't you?</p>
            <p>Florence says she enjoyed her stay in <place key="chicago">Chicago</place> very much indeed, and she has certainly come back as enthusisatic a Chicagoan as I could wish. She seems to have completely lost her heart to <persName key="carl_sandburg">Sandburg</persName>, which is as it should be.</p>
            <closure>Always affectionately yours,</closure>
