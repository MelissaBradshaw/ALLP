            <p>I enclose the new proof of "<title key="nationalismInArt" level="a">Nationalism in Art</title>" which I am sending off within the hour 
               of having received it, down by messenger, and with a Special Delivery stamp on it.</p>
            <p>I cannot quite remember where the last proof ended, but I fear it was with the words 
               “artist untouched,” and in that case the beginning of the following sentence has been dropped 
               out, as you will see by examining the proof. In case I am wrong it should read straight on from 
               the last proof, so will you please look this up and see that it is all right? <add place="above" type="insertion" rend="blueInk">You that this 
               proof was correct.</add> As a matter of fact, one whole word has been left out, and the punctuation has 
               been changed in a number of places. Very often I prefer your punctuation to my original one. 
               The semicolons which you have put in are a great addition, but in the case of the comma which I 
               have put back into the proof, it is absolutely necessary. The sentence is “Clearly he has none of 
               the national traits of these or any
           <pb n="02"> other foreign, countries,” and the meaning is slightly changed 
               unless you make it read “these countries or any other foreign countries”.

                   composite <gap><desc>[illegible text]</desc></gap> noun which ‘foreign country’ has become.</add></p>
