                <p>No proof has yet arrived. I hope it will <date when="1914-10-17">this afternoon</date>. By this time, you have got my letter and will see that I was pretty sore when I wrote it. I do not think it was surprising. Your letter read “<persName key="lucy_monroe_calhoun">Lucy</persName> says we ought to have <title key="bombardment" level="a">“The Bombardment”</title> why don’t you send it on? If it must go with the other, send that too and we’ll take another squint at it.” It certainly was tantamount to saying you would take <title key="bombardment" level="a">“The Bombardment”</title> any way and would reconsider <title key="allies" level="a">“The Allies.”</title>  Certainly that was the way I construed it.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I am a little sensitive about my position in regard to editors and my brother poets. In old days it used to be a stigma to be indigent now it is a stigma to have any money and I run up against it at every turn. I believe a real, unbiased opinion is one of the rarest things to be found in our so-called democracy.</p>
                <p>Now I am [sentence cut off] <pb n="2"> a favor. Don’t you want to review <title key="swordBladesAndPoppySeeds" level="m">my book</title>  some time within the next two or three months? You are welcome to pitch into it as much as you want to, of course, but it will be a help to me to have it reviewed, and don’t you want me to review <title key="youAndI" level="m">yours</title>? You have to have it done “out of the family” as it were and I should like very much to say some nice things about it.</p>
                <closer>Very sincerely yours,</closer>
