                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>Thank you very much for this cheque, which I am delighted to receive. But where
                <title key="poetry" level="j">“Poetry”</title> is, I am at a loss to say. Your letter was dated <date when="1915-03-29">March 29th,</date> and in it you say that you
                were sending “Poetry” with it. This is <date when="1915-04-05">April 5th,</date> and no “Poetry” has appeared. Neither have the
                <orgName key="oldCornerBookstore">Old Corner Book Store</orgName> got their copies; so I suppose the whole edition is late. I do think, if I am
                allowed to make a criticism, that it ought to come out promptly on the first.</p>
            <p>Also you should see that some book shop in <placeName key="nyc">New York</placeName> carries it. I tried to buy it at
                <orgName key="bretano">Brentano’s,</orgName> and they had only some very old numbers, and I found no other book shop where
                they had even that. I would drum them up about it if I were you.</p>
            <p>I am awfully sorry that you will not come East this <date when="1915">Spring;</date> and I see no chance whatever
                of my going West. Still, I hope that we shall meet again some day. It is a shame that <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName>
                and <pb n="02"><placeName key="boston">Boston</placeName> are so far apart.</p>
            <closer>A great deal of love.</closer>
