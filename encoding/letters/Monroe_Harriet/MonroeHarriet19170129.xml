                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener>
                <p>I have heard nothing from you in regard to <title key="lacquer_prints" level="a">&quot;Lacquer Prints&quot;</title>, so I presume you are taking them, as you have had them one month now. As I told you before, they must be printed in either your <date when="1917-03">March</date> or <date when="1917-04">April</date> <title key="poetry" level="j">numbers</title>, as they are to be included in our Anthology. Again as I have not heard from you, and as I told you this when I originally sent them, I suppose you have made arrangements to that effect. I do wish, my dear girl, that you would answer these things a little sooner, as it is awfully awkward to have poems out and not know exactly what is happening to them.</p>          
                <p><title key="sea_blue_and_blood_red" level="a">&quot;Sea-Blue and Blood-Red&quot;</title> has been accepted in toto by <title key="northAmericanReview" level="j">he &quot;North American Review&quot;</title> — the first time they have ever printed so long a poem, and it took them just twenty-four hours to make the decision.</p>
                <p>I hope you are getting your guarantors all right. Anyway, I shall see all the news now, when I come.</p>
                <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
