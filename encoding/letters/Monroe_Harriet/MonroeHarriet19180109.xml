                    <physDesc> <p>This is a two-page letter. On the left upper corner is Harriet's address: “Miss Harriet Monroe,
                        Editor “Poetry” 543 Cass Street, Chicago, Ill.” And there is a faint print on the upper part of the paper. On the top 
                        right of the second page is “Miss Harriet Monroe – 2,” and the date of the letter is repeated: “9, January 8.” Also, by the 
                        end of the letters, there is an inscription that says “Appuldurcombe Park Misericordia.” </p>

                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet:–</persName></salute></opener>
                <p>Thank you very much for the cheque of <measure type="currency" num="75"> seventy&ndash;five dollars,</measure> which came duly to hand. 
                    I do not think the <title key="<!--> cual es<-->" level="a">“Landlady”</title> looks badly at all. I have another poem for you for some 
                    time in the future &ndash; one of the best things I have done since <title key="patterns" level="a">“Patterns”</title> I think.
                    I am enclosing it, which does not mean that I want you to print it now, but merely that I thought you might like to have a shot 
                    at it before I let it go anywhere else. If you like it, you can print it some time in <date when="1918">the summer.</date> I know it is good. So is this other 
                    little one which I am enclosing, and which I also think is one of the very best things of its kind I have done. If you want either
                    of these, or both, they are at your service.</p>
                <p>I was interested to read what you wrote of <persName key="<!--> esta mal escrito?? <-->">Kreymbourg’s</persName> plays. That man has very interesting style I think.
                    I have never read any of his plays, but I like some of his poems very much.</p>
                <p>I am terribly sorry for one thing, and that is the rift in the ranks of the new poets. They all seem to be as much concerned
                    in the fighting one another as in fighting the Philistines and that I deprecate from the bottom of my heart, but perhaps intolerance 
                    is a natural ingredient of youth. Not being young, I do not feel it.</p>
                <p>Don’t you want to let me review <persName key="william_bradley">Bradley&apos;s</persName> <title key="<!--> No agregado<-->" level="<!--> nose el nivel <-->">“Old Christmas”</title> for you? I cannot let you have it before April or May, I am so busy, but
                    if there is not anybody else whom you want to review it, I should like to. </p>
                <p>I hear you are buried in snow in <placeName key="chicago">Chicago.</placeName> We have not any snow <placeName key="brookfield">here</placeName> to speak of, but we have
                    had the most awful cold you can easily imagine, and no coal.</p>
                <pb="n2">
                <p>With all good wishes for the New Year, my dear,</p>
                <closer> Affectionately yours,</closer>
