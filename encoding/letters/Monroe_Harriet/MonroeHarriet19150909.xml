                <p> Here is a check for <measure type="currency" num="50">$50</measure> I promised you on the <date when= 1915 08 01> first of August </date> 
                    and entirely forgot to send. I am sorry I cannot make it <measure type="currency" num="100">$100</measure>, but things are not so 
                    bright with me as to enable me to do that at the moment. And, by the way, I think you owe 
                    me <measure type="currency" num="77">$77</measure> from my last page of poems, 
                    but it seems to me better for me to send you a check and for you to send me one than to just have you send me the balance. 
                    It is more business-like this way.</p>  
                <p> I am awfully pleased with the looks of my poems in the September number .<anchor xml:id= "n1"</anchor> 
                    <tile key="leadSoldiers" level= "a">&quot;Lead Soldiers&quot;</tile> came out very well I think, in spite of the printer forgetting some 
                    of the stanza spacing. I thank you very much for the pleasant little notice about me in the end, with its remark 
                    about the forthcoming book,and cheering up polyphonic prose. As to your article in answer 
                    to <persName key="conrad_aiken">Conrad Aiken</persName>it is a perfect wonder — one of the best things I ever read, and I am absolutely 
                    delighted with it. By-the-way, I don&apos;t think I ever told you how much I liked some of your poems in the August number, 
                    particularly <title key="fromThePorch" level="a"> &quote;From the Porch.&quote;</title></p>
                <p> I got your postal from the Fair<anchor xml:id = "n2"</anchor>, and it made me die of longing to be there, but I have been 
                    on the treadmill all the <date when= "1915">summer</date> getting through this book, and not able to go anywhere. It has been 
                    perfectly awful <date when="1915">summer</date>, and I hope the reception of the book will justify me for very nearly breaking down 
                    under it.</p>
                <p> I ordered six copies of <title key= "poetry" level="j">&quote;Poetry&quote;</title> to be sent me from
                    <pb ="n2">
                    <orgName key="oldCornerBookstore">the Old Corner Book Store </orgName>, and they report they have not receive their September numbers yet.
                    I have a theory that they lie dreadfully, for mine came a week ago. I told them to send a special order through for me, because I thought 
                    it just as well to send it through a book shop and make the book shop sit up and take notice. But if they have never written you, I wish you 
                    would send me six copies direct, and I will send you check for them. </p>
                <p> I quite agree with what you say about <persName key="wallace_stevens">Stevens&apos;s</persName> &quote;Peter Quince.&quote;<anchor xml:id="n4"/> I think that is a splendid poem. 
                    What do you know about the man, anything? </p>
                <p> hope you had a splendid time out West. I suppose you are safely back now? </p>
