                    <p>Of course, I take your letter exactly as you mean it, but I happen to be so husky just at
                        this moment that I cannot feel that the disposition of my will are of any immediate importance.</p>
                    <p>The subject is not a new one to me. I have thought it over several times. Up to date, however,
                        I have not been able to satisfy myself that it is a wise thing to endow the arts. It seems
                        as if the recipients of these endowments were always the wrong people; and how one could 
                        arrange to get the right people in the line of prizes, I do not know. However, to paraphrase 
                        <orgName key="gilbertAndSullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan:</orgName></p>
                    <quote type="english"><p>To the matter that you mention</p>
                        <p>I will give my best attention.</p></quote>
                    <p>I have the cause of poetry as much at heart as you have, and I have thought of this for a 
                        long time; but whether the difficulties will be insurmountable in the end, I cannot now say. </p>
                    <p>I was very glad to hear what <persName key="mary_colum">Mrs. Colum</persName> said <pb n="02"><!-- penciled in -->and I (indecipherable) myself.<!-- end pencil --> The attitude of 
                        New York is utterly inconceivable to me. I am bound to confess, I think perhaps <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra’s</persName> articles,
                        pitching into everything American, from the beginning of the magazine up to date, have had something 
                        to do with it. This is not a criticism upon your having him in; I am not <persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher;</persName> he told me he had 
                        written to you, and then he showed me your letter in return, and I must say you are uncommonly 
                        generous to take criticisms as you do.</p>
                <pb n="02"><p>By the way, Ezra’s new book <title key="cathay" level="m">“Cathay”</title> is full of the most beautiful things. I have 
                        seldom read anything finer. What a pity the boy does not confine himself to working and leave
                        strictures on other people’s work alone. I would rather like to review it, but I am a little
                            afraid that, if I do, he will think I am trying to curry favour with him. What do you think?</p>
