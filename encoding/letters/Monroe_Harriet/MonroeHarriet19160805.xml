                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener><p>Of course I will let you wait a little while before paying me for <title key="1777" level="a">&quot;1777,&quot;</title> but your sum of <measure type="currency" num="45">$45.00</measure> is a little surprise to me, as I thought it was <measure type="currency" num="60">$60.00</measure>, although I see that <measure type="currency" num="60">$60.00</measure> would be more than the pages come to. I have not my files up here, but I thought that when you were to print &quot;The Turnpike,&quot; you were to give me <measure type="currency" num="75">$75.00</measure>, and that when I changed from <title key="turnpike" level="a">&quot;the Turnpike&quot;</title> to <title key="1777" level="a">&quot;1777&quot;</title> at your desire, I objected to the fact that I was to lose money; but you said you could not give me more than <measure type="currency" num="60">$60.00</measure>. At your regular rates, <title key="1777" level="a">&quot;1777&quot;</title> would come to <measure type="currency" num="56">$56.00</measure>. If, however, you are quite sure that <measure type="currency" num="45">$45.00</measure> is what you agreed to pay, we will let it go at that. I think the poem looks very well.</p>
<p>Who is <persName key="victor_starbuck">Mr. Victor Starbuck</persName>? For I especially like his lyric, and I think I shall write him a 
letter, in care of you, and tell him so.</p>
                <p>I am glad you like the <persName key="mary_aldis" ><title key="flashlights">&quot;Flashlights&quot;</title></persName> review. Of course, put my name at the end. I sort of assumed that you would, which is the reason it was not on the manuscript.</p
                <p>I am glad you are going to leave out <title key="painterOnSilk" level="a">&quot;The Painter on Silk&quot;</title> for the<title key="newPoetryAnthology" level="m">Anthology</title>, and substitute either <title key="chinoiseries" level="a">&quot;Chinoiseries&quot;</title> or <title key="theCapturedGoddess" level="a">&quot;The Captured Goddess.&quot;</title> As between these two, I think perhaps <title key="theCapturedGoddess" level="a">&quot;The Captured Goddess&quot;</title> would be the better understood  and the more popular, although I am especially fond of <title key="chinoiseries" level="a">&quot;Chinoiseries&quot;</title> myself. So you see, I have no preference and will leave to you. I understand that my group now stands:</p>

                    <title key="chinoiseries" level="a">&quot;Chinoiseries&quot;</title> or <title key="theCapturedGoddess">&quot;The Captured Goddess&quot;</title>

                    <title key="apology" level="a">&quot;Apology&quot;</title>
                    <p>I still maintain that <title key="malmaison" level="a">&quot;Malmaison&quot;</title> in the August <!--which august?--> <title key="littleReview" level="j">&quot;Little Review&quot;</title> is the best poem I have written, although possibly it is too long for you, although I believe <persName key="ws_braithwaite">Braithwaite</persName> is to use it in his <title key="magazineVerse">Magazine Anthology</title>. However, I am quite pleased with the group as it stands.</p>
