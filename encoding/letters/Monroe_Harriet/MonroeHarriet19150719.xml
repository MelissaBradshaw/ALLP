                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener>
                <p>I am sending you 10 copies of the June number of <title key="egoist" level="j">“The Egoist,”</title> in hopes that you may
                persuade <orgName key="mclurg">McClurg</orgName> to take them, since he had ten copies of the May number.</p>
                <p>I wish the spirit would move you to answer in <title key="poetry" level="j">“Poetry”</title> <persName key="conrad_aiken">Conrad Aiken’s</persName> violent diatribe
                    against us in the July <title key="poetryJournal" level="j">“Poetry Journal.”</title> The poor, little “Poetry Journal” is trying to bring itself
                up to date very hard. It asked me for contributions, as you see by their announcing a poem of
                mine for <date when="1915-08">August;</date> and it has also asked me to write a short article explaining our views for the
                nine hundredth time.</p>
                <p>I suppose I could answer Aiken myself, but I do not want to let him draw me like that;
                    and if you could see your way to putting in a short comment over your own or <persName key="ac_henderson">Alice Henderson’s</persName>
                signature, on the general pigheadedness and reactionary quality of this article, I should be
                eternally <pb n="02">grateful. I am having them send you a copy so you can see it. We do have a hard time.
                It is all up-hill work for all of us, which is the chief reason it is ridiculous to quarrel among
                ourselves. Nobody objects to it so much as I, and I wish <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra</persName> had not such a passion for it. If you
                do not want to do this, of course don’t but it would be fine if you would.</p>
                <p>Have you found out whether McClurg sold any of those ten numbers he took, for he has
                not sent me any money?</p>
                <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
