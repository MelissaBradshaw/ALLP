                <p><measure type="currency" num="45">Forty-five dollars</measure> let it be then. I am awfully sorry that you do not want either of these articles of <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard&apos;s</persName>, but I do hope that you will certainly take some of the poems, even if you do not like them very well. Sometimes one must stand on past achievements, and even if you do not like these poems, Richard is in a position now where encouragement means a great deal; and the poems are nothing like as bad as many of those you publish every month. Personally, of course, I like them, as I told you before; even if I did not, they are quite up to the standard of many of the verses in your paper, and under the circumstances I hope you will take some of them and publish them soon. He needs the money, he needs the encouragement, and he is going into the trenches as a private — and you know what that means.</p>
<p>I am sorry you are so hot. We are rather unpleasantly cool, but we have had it hot.</p>
                <p>I have written to <persName key="mary_aldis">Mrs. Aldis</persName> to know if my poems are really coming out at her <placeName key="chicago"></placeName><placeName key="little_theatre">little theatre</placeName>; and if they are, I shall see you very soon.</p>
                <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
