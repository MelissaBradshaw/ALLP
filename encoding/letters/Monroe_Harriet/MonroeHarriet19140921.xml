                <p>I apologise, but it was not because I did not read what you wrote, <del rend="strikethrough">because</del><add place="above">but</add> I read it wrong. I thought that the slip said &quot;<persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName> read this,&quot; reading <persName key="harriet_monroe">&quot;Harriet&quot;</persName> for &quot;hadn&apos;t&quot;. Indeed I always read everything you write; most carefully, <del rend="strikethrough">because</del><add>but</add> I admit I am rotten about reading hand-writing.</p>
                <p>I did not ask you to send me back the manuscript of <title level="a">my review</title> on <persName key="gf_norton">Miss Norton&apos;s</persName> <title key="sisterWind" level="m">book</title>,<anchor xml:id="n1"/> merely the proof, so I return it exactly as it was with only two changes which you may take out if you want to<del>,</del><add>.</add> <del rend="overstrike">f</del><add>F</add>irst<del>y,</del><add>,</add> the quotation about the &quot;teak forest<del rend="strikethrough">.</del>&quot; I do think <del rend="strikethrough">it</del>is  too funny<del>.</del> <add place="above">to leave on T - | . Second,</add><!--The transcriber was unsure about this, and I am also unsure. Transcriber did not include the | character in their transcription, I have added it here. - blw--> I <del rend="strikethrough">also</del> prefer  the repetition of <persName key="gf_norton">&quot;Miss Norton&quot;</persName> in the second paragraph as a little more formal where it is used, so I have put that back. If it makes you very unhappy, why take it out. I regret your insistence upon my leaving out the last paragraph, but bow to your desire and let you leave it. <add place="right">out.</add></p>
                <p>They have been copying my <title key="coalPicker" level="a">&quot;Coal Picker&quot;</title> in a great many papers, I see. The last one I received is the <title key="bostonAmerican" level="j">&quot;Boston American,&quot;</title> and to my great regret they never mentioned the fact that it appeared in <title key="poetry" level="j">&quot;Poetry.&quot;</title> I have written them a letter and blown them up about it.</p>
                <p>Did I tell you that I met a <persName>man</persName> in <placeName key="london">London</placeName> who was perfectly delighted with my <title>&quot;Vers Libre and Metrical Prose&quot; article</title>? He said it told him what he had always wanted to know and had never been able to find in English.</p>
                <p>Do read my <title key="letterFromLondon" level="a">&quot;London Letter&quot;</title> in the <date when="1914-10">October</date> <title key="littleReview" level="j">&quot;Little Review.&quot;</title> It has nothing to do with poetry, but I think it may interest you. You do not answer me about reviewing <persName key="robert_frost">Mr. Frost&apos;s</persName> <title key="northOfBoston">book</title>.</p>
                <p>That name is <persName key="lorna_amussen">Mrs. T<del rend="strikethrough">C.</del><add place="above">heodore</add> Amussen.</persName></p>
                <p>Please don&apos;t think I am a horrid disagreeable thing. I do take a great many of your suggestions, you know. Have you forgiven me?</p>
                <closer>Always yours,</closer>
