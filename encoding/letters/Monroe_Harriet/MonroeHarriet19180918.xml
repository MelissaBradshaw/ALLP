<p>Thank you ever so much for your nice letter. The operation <!--Operation refers to her a surgery performed on her.--> was done last Thursday, and I am, as you see, once more able to dictate letters  but I am not able to do anything else, and I am beginning to feel as if I were nailed into bed and were never going to be able to get out of it. However, I shall certainly take your advice, for I know it is good, and sit here until all danger of overdoing is past. In fact, my doctor is a perfect old curmudgeon and refuses to let me up for at least a week more and not downstairs for an indefinite time after that. He says that he is going to have no lingering effects from this operation.</p>
<p>I am awfully glad that you like <persName key="florence_ayscough">Florence Ayscough</persName>’s and my Chinese poems. I should have told you that of course I will correct the proof, and you can send the money to me, and all those little details, and I will divvy up with her, according to arrangements.</p>
<p>I am getting more and more thrilled about the <title key="firFlowerTablets" level="a">book</title> that we are going to publish after the war, mostly Florence, of course, but with me to help on these renderings. I think it will be interesting.</p>
<p>With many thanks for your solicitude,</p>
<closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
