                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener>
                <p>I am enclosing <title key="leadSoldiers">“Lead Soldiers.”</title> Of course you want it. You have got to want it. I
                    consider it the best thing I have done. You must want it. You shall want it. Now be good and
                    want it! I don’t agree with you a bit about its not going with the others. I think it would make the
                    head of a group very well. I would not put it at the end.</p>
                <p> As you know, you have had some of my things since <date when="1914-05">last May,</date> and I should like them to
                    appear during the <date when="1915">summer</date>. You have printed me a lot, and I am very grateful; but I do want to
                    head the number again soon.</p>
                <p> I am glad you like the looks of the <title key="some_imagist_poets" level="m">Anthology</title> and I hope you will like the inside as well.
                    I guess you did not read the preface carefully, or you would have seen why we mentioned the
                    other Anthology: merely to explain our schism and how much we held with it and how much we
                    didn’t.</p>
                <p> &#182; Please look at my poem that is coming out <!--The portion of the paragraph before this comment is pencilled in, may need more annotation - TM --><pb n="02">in the Imagist number of
                    <title key="egoist" level="j">“The Egoist.”</title> I think you will like it.</p>
                <closer>Always with a great deal of love,</closer>
                <p>  (Break for signature)</p>
                <postscript><p><label>P.S.</label> I enclose cheque to pay for the extra copies of <title key="poetry" level="j">“Poetry.”</title></p>
                <p>Do you want to ask <orgName key="mclurg">McClurg</orgName> if they won’t take 25 or 30 copies of the Imagist number of
                    “The Egoist” for sale on commission? I have <orgName key="gommesBookshop">Gomme’s bookshop</orgName> in <placeName key="nyc">New York</placeName> to take 50
                    copies, and the <orgName key="oldCornerBookstore">Old Corner Bookstore</orgName> here the same. They, of course, are not paying anything for
                    them, and they will gain by their own commission if they sell any. If you could make the same
                    arrangement with McClurg, I think it would be fine. I can send them copies as soon as they send
                    them to me. As you were mentioned in that, <persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher</persName> having designated you <quote type="english">“the discoverer of
                    Imagism”</quote> it ought to be a good thing for you as well as for us. <persName key="harriet_weaver">Miss Weaver</persName> will let us have them
                    for <measure type="currency" num="1.35">$1.35.</measure></p>
                 <p>(Indecipherable) they tell me at the Old Corner Bookstore here that they can retail them
                     at <measure type="currency" num=".25">25¢.</measure></p></postscript> <!--This paragraph is pencilled in, may need more annotation - TM -->
                <closer>A great deal of love.</closer>
