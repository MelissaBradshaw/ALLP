                <salute>My dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Miss Monroe</persName>:</salute></opener>    
            <p>Let me thank you very much for this cheque of <measure type="currency" num="100">$100.00</measure>, and for your two notes, all of which
               came this morning. I am afraid you will think me a great pig not to return this cheque as you
               suggest, but the truth is that I like to keep my earnings and my donations separate, and also I am
               a little stuck this month, myself, and have unfortunately arranged to spend your cheque, knowing
               it was coming, before I received it.</p>
            <p>I am truly sorry if this embarrasses you in any way, and I shall be very glad to send you
                $100.00, half of what I promised, on the first of <date when="1914-05">May</date>, the balance to be paid, as agreed, on the
               first of August.</p>
            <p>I am sending <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra</persName> a small sum as a wedding present, so that will help along, if you want to
               send him anything before receiving my cheque on the first of May. I will send it to you on the
               very first day, so that that won’t, 
            <pb n="02">I hope,put you out very much.</p>
            <p>I see from this cheque that you have paid me for "<title key="taleOfStarvation" level="a">A Tale of Starvation</title>," as well as the other
               poems, for which I am most delighted and grateful, and I hope that this means that you will truly
               publish it.</p>
            <p>Of course you remember that in sending these poems, I stipulated that they should come out
               before <date when="1914-10">October</date>, as I wish to incorporate them in <title key="swordBladesAndPoppySeed" level="m">my book</title> which is to be published on the first of
               October. The October number will be all right, if you cannot get them in before.</p>
            <p>As far as the copyright notices are concerned, we are to have the copyright notices, including
               yours, on the reverse of the title, and the acknowledgments under the table of contents. I hope
               that this will satisfy you.</p>
            <p>Do you want me to review <persName key="gf_norton">Grace Fallow Norton’s</persName> new book<!-- do we know what book this is? --> for you? Don’t bother to send it,
               if you do. I have it, and can send you a review quite easily for the <title key="poetry" level="j">May number</title>.</p>
            <p>I hope that my delaying three weeks in sending you the money will not make a great
               difference to you, as it does really make considerable difference to me at the moment.</p>
