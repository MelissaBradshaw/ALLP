                <salute>My dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Ms. Monroe</persName>,</salute></opener>
            <p>This is just a little line to thank you for your very great kindness to me during my brief stay in
               <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName> I wish I could have stayed longer. It is the one city in America where one does not feel
               “cabbaged, cribbed, confined.” <placeNece key="nyc">New York</placeNece> is just as old fogey as <placeName key="boston">Bost</placeName> on, as far as poetry is concerned.
               Among the poets, I mean, I had two to dinner tonight. They admired old <persName key="george_woodbury">Mr. Woodbury</persName>, and thought
               <persName key="ws_braithwaite">William Stanley Braithwaite’s</persName> opinion had great weight, and that his "<title key="poetryJournal">Poetry Journal</title>" had printed some
               excellent things. I longed for you, and <persName key="ac_henderson">Mrs. Henderson</persName>, and <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra</persName> and <persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher</persName>, to make a party with. We
               are all in the van, and these people! How hardly the generation dies! The editors are a little better, I
               think. I have not seen any magazine editors yet, but the book publishers seem to live more in the
               present. I am very glad you took those things for "<title key="poetry" level="j">Poetry</title>." It pleases me to have them there. We are
               such a handful, against the others. I hear a rumor that Ezra has come over with <persName key="wb_yeats">Yeats</persName>. He did not speak
               as though he were coming, to me. And I got his last letter just before I left home. I will send you my
               things, just as soon as I get home to a typewriter. In the meantime, thank you again, most cordially—
               And please remember me to Mrs. Henderson. I liked her so much.</p>
            <p>Don’t suspend the magazine, if we lose it, we are shoved back another 10 years! And please
               send me your play to read<!-- do we know what play she is talking about? -->, as you promised.</p> 
            <closer>Sincerely yours,    
                <signed><persName key="Amy Lowell">Amy Lowell</persName></signed></closer>   
            <postscript>  
            <p>I wish you would send me books for review, I like doing it and they shall be whatever length you
                choose</p>
            </postscript>
