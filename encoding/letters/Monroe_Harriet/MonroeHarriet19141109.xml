                <p>Two notes from you came <date when="1914-11-09">this morning</date>. It is awfully nice of you to review <title key="swordBladesAndPoppySeeds" level="m">by(sic)<!--The sic was not in the original transcription - blw--> book</title> so soon. <title key="youAndI" level="m">Yours</title> has not come yet nor the numbers of <title key="poetry" level="j">&quot;Poetry&quot;</title> which you say were mailed on <date when="1914-10-31">October 31st</date>. and <orgName key="oldCornerBookstore">the Old Corner Book Store</orgName> reports that they have not got their numbers yet. I wish we could all make a stand against the uncertainty and slowness of Uncle Sam&apos;s mail. It is perfectly abominable. I have had so many mistakes with the complimentary copies of my book that were sent round that I know them well.</p>
                <p>What you say about <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra</persName> cheers me up considerably. I suppose he will get over it and I am glad he wrote you the letter he did but you are quite right about my being too sensitive and I greatly admire the way your(sic)<!--The sic was not in the original transcription - blw--> go on regardless of what they write to you. Although I am going to say such nice things in that review.</p>
                <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
