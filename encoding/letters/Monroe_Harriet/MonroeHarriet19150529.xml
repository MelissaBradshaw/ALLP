                    <salute>Dear <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName>:</salute></opener>
                    <p>I am not frightfully flush this year. I am afraid nobody is; and I am afraid 
                        I can only agree to give you <measure type="currency" num="50">$50</measure>. in cash on the <date when="1915-08-01">first of August</date>, instead of
                        <measure type="currency" num="100">$100</measure>. as I gave you <date when="1914">last year</date>. But I am putting in a big, full-page advertisement
                        of <title key="some_imagist_poets" level="m">“Some Imagist Poets”</title> in your <title key="poetry" level="m">July issue</title>. I have just given the order to 
                        <orgName key="houghton_mifflin">Houghton Mifflin</orgName>. And my French lectures are coming out in the <date when="1915">Autumn</date> and will,
                        of course, be advertised for two or three months in your paper. So I can make 
                        up the <measure type="currency" num="100">$100</measure>. in that way; in fact, it will make more. If I find on the first of 
                        August that I have enough to give you more, I certainly will. Perhaps when the 
                        account of my various books comes in, I shall have a little more than I think, 
                        in which case I shall certainly complete my donation in cash to the extent of 
                        my ability. </p>
                    <p>I hope you and <persName key="ac_henderson">Alice Henderson</persName> are reviewing “Some Imagist Poets” pretty soon. 
                        We are <pb n="02">getting fine black eyes all over the place. Did you see <persName key="conrad_aiken">Conrad Aiken’s</persName> 
                        in the last <title key="newRepublic" level="j">“New Republic?”</title></p>
                    <p>I am going to suggest to “The New Republic” writing up your magazine for some 
                        early Autumn number, and giving a list of your most unusual accomplishment in 
                        it. If they won’t take it, and I should not wonder if they would not, I shall 
                        try to do it for the <title key="transcript" level="j">“Transcript”</title> here. I think October or November would be a
                        good time, when people are back in town and considering
                        <pb n="02">subscriptions and things for the winter. As I wrote you, I have 
                        been so impressed with what you have done since your starting and I think it 
                        ought to have some great heralding.</p>
                    <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
