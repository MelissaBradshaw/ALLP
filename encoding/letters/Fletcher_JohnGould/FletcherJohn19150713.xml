            <salute>My dear Mr. <persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher</persName>:</salute></opener>
         <p>I am very sorry to hear that your <persName>sister</persName><!--not sure if this is Adolphine Fletcher Terry or Mary Fletcher Drennan--> is ill. I hope by this time she is ever so much
            better. <persName key="ada_russell">Mrs. Russell</persName> has been ill; we were afraid of typhoid at one time, but it turned
            out not to be that, I am thankful to say. She is still in bed with a trained nurse<!--should "nurse" be tagged?-->, and
            our moving to <placeName key="dublin">Dublin</placeName> is postponed. If she is well enough, she will go to <placeName key="saltLakeCity">Salt Lake City</placeName>
            the end of July, as she planned, and once she is gone, I shall go up to Dublin. But at
            the moment, everything is uncertain.</p>
         <p>I am sending you a letter which I received yesterday addressed to you in <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName>’s
            handwriting. He seems to be very much worried lest they conscript him, which would be an
            awful blow for our cause. He tells me that he and <persName key="fs_flint">Flint</persName> are writing the article for the
            "<title key="mercureDeFrance">Mercure</title>;" and he also tells me that he has written an article on me for "<title key="egoist">The Egoist</title>,"
            which I think is very nice <gap reason="illegible" quantity="10" unit="character"/> that they will not come over here;</pb>
            that they cannot, in fact, as he does not believe he could get permission. And I am
            afraid that may be true.</p>
         <p>Did you see "<title key="others">Others</title>?" I have it – a most wretched little paper, at least judging by the
            first number. I feel rather sorry that I sent them anything; but it cannot be helped
            now.</p>
         <p>Your friend <persName key="brownStudio">Brown</persName> of the <orgName key="studioBookshop">Studio Bookshop</orgName> has been so very nice to me that I took a leaf
            out of your book and sent him one of my poems, "La Vie de Bohême." I do not think you
            remember it; it was written about a year ago, and is not one I care much for, but they
            have accepted it with glee.</p>
         <p>You will be amused to hear that the "<title key="century">Century</title>" has taken "The Paper Windmill." I believe
            they think it is prose and will print is as such, but perhaps that is better than
            nothing.</p>
         <p>"<title key="newRepublic">The New Republic</title>" has ordered a sort of boiling down of my Round Table lecture: viz. a
            fifteen-hundred-word article on "The New Manner in Modern Poetry." I am very much
            pleased with that. I have sent them your "Clipper Ship" and implored them to take it;
            but they are so queer <add place="below">that I do not known what they will do. I will let</add></pb> you know as soon
            as I hear. There is nothing further here. I am going to begin my French translations
            this week, as they delay makes it impossible for me to wait until I get to Dublin. I am
            pretty tired as there has been a good deal of anxiety over Mrs. Russell, but I am
            feeling better now, and hope to get these translations done sometime.</p>
         <p>I hope things are looking up with you and that the four-year-old youngster is not too
            obstreperous.</p>
         <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
