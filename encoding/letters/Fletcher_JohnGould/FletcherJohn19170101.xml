                        <p>This letter is 1 page long (seq. 91). It is typed on good quality typing paper 
                            (neither notebook paper nor Lowell’s nice cardstock, but somewhere in between). 
                            The words “John Gould Fletcher” are written in pencil across the top of the first page. </p>

                <salute>Dear <persName key="john_fletcher">J.G.F.</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>
                I am sending you a copy of <persName key="ws_braithwaite">Braithwaite</persName>’s “<title key="magazineVerse">Anthology</title>”, which is not as good as last year’s. 
                That unfortunate remark about me and the Imagists appears in the Preface and makes me sick. 
                But he does say some awfully good things about you, and he has included your “<title key="goblinsAndPagodas">Goblins and Pagodas</title>” among the worthwhile books, 
                as you will see – not, I am sorry to say, in the back of this book, but at the end of the Preface. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Braithwaite is a difficult man to manage, as you know well; and I really <sic>thing</sic> he has gone quite to pieces lately. 
                But, for Heaven’s sake, don’t think I had anything to do with the “Anthology”!  
                I did not see it until it was written, and I have hardly laid eyes on Braithwaite this Summer and this Winter. 
                It is a terrible thing to me to realize that you are so suspicious and do not trust me. In fact, it has made me very unhappy, 
                for I am sure you did not mean to do it. I wish you would write to me soon, and dispel the impression 
                which your letter of <date when="1916-12-07">December 7th</date> left. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Nothing makes me more unhappy than to feel that you and I are at variance in any way, 
                so I feel no sympathy with any other poet such as that I feel with you. This is New Year’s Day, 
                and I wish you every sort of happy New Year, and above all, may we have no misunderstandings in it. 
            </p>
            <closer>Always affectionately,</closer>,
        </body>
    </text>
