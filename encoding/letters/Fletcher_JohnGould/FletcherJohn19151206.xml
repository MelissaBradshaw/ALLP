            <salute>Dear <persName key="john_fletcher">J.G.F.</persName>,</salute></opener>
         <lg>
            <l>To-night you said a thing</l>
            <l>Which left me much upset and wondering.</l>
          
            <l>You seemed to feel that rhyming was so hard</l>
            <l>To have the knack made any man a bard.</l>
          
            <l>To turn out couplets fast as you could think</l>
            <l>Was quite a worthy use of printer’s ink.</l>
          
            <l>But pointing to your friend whom I’ll not name </l>
            <l>I said his verse would put a child to shame.</l>
          
            <l>To reach the end within a given time</l>
            <l>And wind up sharply on a tidy rhyme</l>
          
            <l>Seemed to call forth a terrible commotion</l>
            <l>And make his brain whirl like a stormy ocean. </l>
        
            <l>Such tricks he used to cause his words to fall </l>
            <l>Each on its accent! And that isn’t all.</l>
         
            <l>Some verbs expanded with that fearful “did,” </l>
            <l>Others condensed; and nothing neatly hid.</l>
          
         <pb/>
          
            <l>Was that a style of which one could be proud?</l>
            <l>I ask you, and my horror cried out loud.</l>
          
            <l>You shook your head. “He rhymes so easily,”</l>
            <l>You sadly murmured, “it amazes me.”</l>
          
            <l>I vowed to you that I could do it too. </l>
            <l>“But he does not repeat him rhymes,” said you.</l>
          
            <l>I told you I could rhyme for half a day, </l>
            <l>You doubted me. And now, behold my way! </l>
         
            <l>Not wishing to admit that I’m defeated </l>
            <l>I’ve done the thing, and not a rhyme repeated.</l>
         
            <l>I could go on like this till you were dead,</l>
            <l>But it is late and I must go to bed.</l>
          
            <l>I’ve proved my point and if these lines don’t go well</l>
            <l>They took me just ten minutes.</l>
         
            <l>P.S. The postscript holds the letter’s kernel, </l>
            <l>So tell me, did you take the <title key="poetryJournal">Poetry Journal</title>?</l>
