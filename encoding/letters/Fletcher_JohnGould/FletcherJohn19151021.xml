            <salute>My dear <persName key="john_fletcher">Mr. Fletcher</persName>:</salute></opener>
         <p>I am very glad indeed to know that you are 
            arriving in <placeName>our town</placeName>, although I confess I wish 
            you had not done so quite so hastily, and had 
            looked over the ground a little bit before you 
            came. I say this purely on your own account, 
            for the ground does not lie quite so well as it 
            will three weeks later. By which I mean that 
            <persName key="engel">Mr. Engel</persName> had an operation yesterday, and is in 
            hospital, and I do not suppose he will be back 
            at his office for three weeks. Under these circumstances, 
            of course, he cannot give you any 
            job to do before that time at least, or so I 
            should imagine. Also I am working night and day 
            on <title>these proofs</title>; and in the few moments after 
            dinner in which I am not hard at work I am a very 
            dull person I am afraid, as the fatigue attendant 
            on so long a stretch of drudgery has almost floored 
            me. However, we will do our best, and I hope that 
            <persName key="ferris_greenslet">Ferris Greenslet</persName> will be able to find 
            you something pending <persName key="engel">Mr. Engel</persName>'s recovery. </p>
         </pb>
         <p>Please telephone me when you reach town, or as soon after you get placed as possible, just to let me 
            give you the glad hand and "welcome to our city." I am afraid there is no use in suggesting that you 
            come out here before Sunday, as I shall really have not a moment to spare. The motor goes back and forth 
            to <placeName>Norwood</placeName> where the press is with copy twice a day, and it leaves me absolutely filled 
            up. My miserable health this summer has delayed the thing a month, and <orgName>the publishers</orgName>are impatient and so am I. </p>
         <p>I shall expect you on Sunday to supper at seven as usual, and we will take up our old routine 
            and have as pleasant a talk as last year. In the meantime, here is the twenty-five dollars, 
            which you may return or not on the first of December, as you please. </p>
         <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
