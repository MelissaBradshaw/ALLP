               <salute>My dear Mr. <persName key="ezra_pound">Pound</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>Thanks for the letter. It took a load off my mind. I quite agree with you about
               correspondency, but I did want to know if you had got the poems. I am glad they are
               all going in.</p>
            <p>The paper is looking up, I think; in the prose articles, I mean. Why did you get out
               of the direct control: A sacrifice to friendship, I imagine. You certainly make an
               excellent friend. By the way, I liked your friend <persName key="richard_aldington"
                  >Richard Aldington</persName>’s poem, <title key="thePoplar">"The Poplar,"</title>
               in current <title key="poetry">"Poetry,"</title> and it was a good idea, your getting
                  <persName key="dh_lawrence">Lawrence</persName> for <persName key="harriet_monroe"
                  >her</persName>.</p>
            <p>I am going out to <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName> next month, to try and
               make her publish some more of my things which she has, and also load some more on
               her, if possible.</p>
            <p>You might send me half a dozen copies of <title key="egoist">"The Egoist"</title>
               which contains my things, if you will, as it cannot be bought in this country.</p>
            <p>I sent some of my things, the other day, to<pb n="2"/>
               <title key="smartSet">"The Smart Set,"</title> with a personal note to Mr. <persName
                  key="willard_wright">Wright</persName>, whereupon they all came travelling home
               again, with a letter from another man, who made no sort of scruple in opening my
               letter, in spite of the docket, and who begged me to send him some more of my work. I
               now see by the papers that Mr. Wright is no longer editor, and they are harking back
               to the old policy of the magazine, so it is no wonder they refused my things, and I
               certainly don’t want to appear in it, if it is going to be the kind of magazine it
               used to was.</p>
            <p>I suppose you are joking</p>
