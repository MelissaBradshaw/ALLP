	        <p>I have told <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard Aldington</persName> of your pleasure in having him send some translations to you, but of course <choice><orig>hehas</orig><reg>he has</reg></choice> not had time to get my letter yet. In the meantime he wrote me another letter and asked me to send you some of his poems which I have here. I have, therefore, picked out two which seemed to me very interesting and he would be very glad indeed if you would care to print them. He is not very well off and I think pay means a good deal to him, but I told him that you had written me that you would not pay anything until <date when="1914-12">December</date>, so that he understands that these poems will be gratis. I think when you begin to pay you will find him one of your most valuable contributors.</p>
	        <p>I think your <title key="littleReview" level="j">magazine</title> is improving every day and I trust that means financial success.</p>
	        <closer>Very sincerely yours,</closer>
