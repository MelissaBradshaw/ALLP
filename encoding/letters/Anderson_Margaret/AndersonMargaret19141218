                    <salute>My dear <persName key="margaret_anderson">Miss Anderson</persName>:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Your request for funds for <title key="littleReview" level="j">“The Little Review”</title> has arrived. For some time I have had
                an idea in my head, and that was one reason why I regretted being obliged to put off my visit to <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName>,
                by which I might make some arrangement with you, I paying a certain sum yearly toward your magazine and
                having the right thereby to contribute to it myself, and also to direct the poetical side.
                To be sure, you have always welcomed the things of mine which
                I have sent most cordially, and also those of other people which I have sent; and I have nothing
                whatever to complain of, therefore, in the handsome manner in which you have treated me;
                but I have been looking out for a long time for a magazine the editorial staff of which I could
                join. I cannot afford to run one entirely alone, but I could quite easily purchase a certain
                interest in your magazine and receive in return certain privileges. Such a position has just been offered me
                on the <title key="egoist" level="j">"Egoist,"</title>
                <pb n="02"/>
                <add place="above" type="insertion" rend="blackInk">London where I was to have the whole charge of</add>
                the literary side of the paper; but I felt it would be impossible to do anything with a paper so 
                far away as <placeName key="london">London</placeName>.</p>
                <p>I should like to work with you, as I am in sympathy with your aims, and I greatly
                    admire the pluck and efficiency with which your paper has been run. Now you may not like
                    this idea of mine at all and in any case I should not be able to put any more 
                    than <measure type="dollars" quantity="1000">$1,000</measure> in it:
                    my idea really was about <measure type="dollars" quantity="500">$500</measure>.
                    With this and the amount your will probably receive from the people to whom you have sent this notice, 
                    it seems to me that your future would be guaranteed.</p>
                <p>If this idea strikes you as worth considering, I will go out to Chicago, as soon after
                    <date when="1914-12-25">Christmas</date> as possible, and talk the matter over with you. Of course, nothing can be arranged
                    definitely by letter. I am a very businesslike person, and everything must be carefully talked
                    over and definitely arranged and put on paper, if we are to have any agreement. I think we
                    could do something that would be mutually satisfactory, and I feel sure from all I know of
                    you that we should 
                <pb n="03"/>
                    work together very well. Do not misunderstand me--
                    I do not in any way mean to put myself on a par with you in running the paper; I should only wish to manage the
                    practical side of it—-be poetry editor in fact. And I think, when I see you, I can prove my
                    fitness for the position to your satisfaction.</p>
                <closer>Yours truly,</closer>
