             <salute>Dear <persName key="margaret_anderson">Miss Anderson</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>I should have answered your very nice note sooner. Thank you for what you say about my poems. I quite agree with you that Mille. Carret’s<!--Magdelaine Carret, found in modjourn little review february number--> criticism does not bite. May I refer you to one that does by <persName key="john_fletcher">Mr. Fletcher</persName> to be published in the <date when="1915-04">April</date> <title key="poetry" level="j">“Poetry”</title>.</p>
            <p>You remember that I was going to write an article on <orgName key="poetryBookshop">“The Poetry Book Shop”</orgName> to soothe <persName key="harold_monro">Harold Munro’s</persName> ruffled feelings. Now in looking through the things he sent me, I find that I have hardly enough data to go on, so I cabled him to send me some more. I also took a wild and unauthorized step by saying in my cable that I was going to put the article into your <title key="littleReview" level="j"><date when="1915-05">May</date> number</title>; so will you be an angel and print it then, as I am beginning to feel a little guilty about not having sent it to you before, but the truth is that I have been so busy getting out our <title key="someImagistPoets" level="m">Anthology</title> and writing and delivering a course of six lectures on French Poetry that I have sometimes had to work fifteen 
            <pb n="2">
            hours a day and this Poetry Book Shop article just had to wait. If he does not send me the data, I will just go ahead and do the best I can with a short appreciation, but I should like to have something that would be a sort of history and appreciation in one.</p>
            <p>Let me tell you how much I enjoy your magazine. I think it gets better and better with every number, and it is the only magazine which I ever really read. I do not have time to read magazines as a rule, but yours is so full of interest, so new and up-to-date, to unprejudiced and full of life that I simply look forward to the coming of each number with the greatest impatience. I thought Mr. Comfort’s<!--I cannot find him :(--> letter in the last number very good and very true. Perhaps you are right to refuse my offer, although in spite of being “businesslike” I am so much in sympathy with everything you are trying to do that I do not think you would have found me quite the fish you imagine. Still, as I say, perhaps you are right, but whatever happens do not let your magazine stop, for we need it and I think the world needs it. All this, of course, is not for publication, merely for private ear and
            <pb n="3">
            your heart. And, by the way, I agreed with everything you said about <persName key="ethis_ellis">Mrs. Ellis’s</persName> lecture, not that I have heard her lecture, but on general principles, I mean.</p>
            <p>By the way, who are you going to have review our “Anthology”? It ought to be somebody with sympathy for our aims and an understanding of new departures. I think it ought to be reviewed soon and reviewed at considerable length, for I cannot help feeling that in fifty years it will be rather an important volume. It may be conceited of me to believe so firmly in our <!--should this be tagged as imagism?-->little group, but I do. All of the poets in it may not pull through to immortality, but I think some of them will. Have you any opinion as to who might review it?</p>
            <closer>Very sincerely yours,</closer>
