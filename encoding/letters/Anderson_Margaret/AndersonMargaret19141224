                    <salute>My dear <persName key="margaret_anderson">Miss Anderson</persName>:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Will you please send me another copy of your <date when="1914-12">December</date> number of
                <title key="littleReview" level="j">“The Little Review?”</title> 
                I enclose <measure type="cents" quantity="15">fifteen cents</measure> in stamps to pay for it.</p>
                <p>I have had a letter from <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard Aldington</persName>. He wants me to put him in touch with you,
                    which I do by telling you that his address is: 8 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, W.,
                    <placeName key="london">London</placeName>. He is very anxious to become your London correspondent; and as I notice by your last
                    number that <persName>Mr. Buxton Shanks</persName> in <rs key="ww1" type="event">leaving for the front</rs>, I have no doubt that this would be an
                    excellent idea. Buxton Shanks is merely a journalist, whereas Richard Aldington is a very
                    unusual fellow and an excellent writer of prose besides his poetry. He is in touch with all the
                    younger authors, and I think you could not do better than take his services. He says he will do it
                    for nothing for the sake of getting his name known to your readers.</p>
                    <pb n="02"/>
                    <p><add place="above" type="insertion" rend="blueInk">I strongly advise you to accept this offer.</add>
                    In fact, I should advise you to do so, even if Mr. Buxton Shanks were not leaving,
                    as I think Mr. Aldington is a very unusual prize to secure, and I don't think it will be long before he is well known and unobtainable.
                    Of course, you will do as you please about this; I merely forward his suggestion and his address, so that you can write to
                    him in person. But if you prefer to have me do it for you, of course I shall be delighted.</p>
                 <closer>Very sincerely yours,</closer>
                 <postscript><label>P.S.</label> Mr. Aldington writes a weekly article in the London <title key="egoist" level="j">“Egoist,”</title>
                     and has a sufficient journalistic training to be in every way proper for the position.</postscript>
