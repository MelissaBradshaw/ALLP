                <salute>My dear <persName key="margaret_anderson">Miss Anderson</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>I have just had word from my friend whom I was to meet in <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName>, and she tells me that we must put off our visit there until after <date when="1914-12-25">Christmas</date>. I shall, therefore, have to lose the pleasure of seeing you for a month longer; but it is sure to happen then.</p>
            <p>My friend whom I wrote you about the other day, <persName key="john_fletcher"><choice><orig>John Gould Flstcher</orig><reg>John Gould Fletcher</reg></choice></persName>, whose work you probably know in <title key="poetry" level="j">“Poetry”</title> and a volume of whose poems is about to be issued by Messrs. <orgName key="houghton_mifflin">Houghton, Mifflin & Company</orgName>, is going to pay a visit to Chicago in the near future; and I am going <choice><orig>totake</orig><reg>to take</reg></choice>the liberty of giving him a letter to you. I think you will find his poems, and possibly even his prose articles, a great addition to your <title key="littleReview" level="j">magazine</title>.
            I have already got a new subscriber for you in <persName key="josephine_peabody">Mrs. Lionel Marks (Josephine 
            <pb n="2">
            Preston Peabody)</persName>, who tells me she has subscribed to “The Little Review” on the strength of seeing a copy here.</p>
            <closer>Until later then, believe me,
            Yours sincerely,</closer>
