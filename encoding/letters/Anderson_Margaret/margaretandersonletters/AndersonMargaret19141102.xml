              <salute>My dear <persName key="margaret_anderson">Miss Anderson</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>I wonder how the editor of the <title key="poetryReview" level="j">“Review”</title> stands opposition when a poor contributor is liable to letters like the enclosed. Who ever would have supposed that my little paragraph poking fun at that ridiculous reading would have been taken so seriously? I have written to <persName key="harold_monro">Mr. Munro</persName><!--AL spells it wrong here, is there anything to do on the encoding side?--> telling him that if you were agreeable I should like to write a serious article on the <orgName key="poetryBookshop">Poetry Book Shop</orgName>, its aims and accomplishments. I am greatly in sympathy with the undertaking which is a magnificent one, and I think such an article would be of great interest to your readers and if it appears over my signature it would act as a kind of plaster upon the irritated sensibilities of those people who may have been offended with my sentences. I should not, of course, refer in any way to the sentences in question in the article and I have told Mr. Munro that I think 
            <pb n="2">
            he is hypersensitive to have taken it as he did.
            <p>I have asked him to send me the history of his undertaking and any simple anecdotes that are worth recording, and if you like the idea I will do the article as soon as I hear from him, which would be in time for the <date when="1914-01">January</date> number, I think.</p>
            <p>I am seriously thinking of coming on to <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName> either this month or next. I have some things I should like to talk over with you which I think may be to our mutual advantage. I am a good deal amused at <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra Pound’s</persName> advertisement of <title key="egoist" level="j">“The Egoist”</title> on your book page, leaving me out as a contributor when they have published a number of my poems, all owing to a simple difference of opinion which I had with him this summer and which I tried so hard to avoid. Certainly the jealousy of poets is quite equal to the <choice><orig>proberbial</orig><reg>proverbial</reg></choice> one of Opera singers.</p>
            <closer>Yours very sincerely,</closer>
