                <salute>My dear <persName key="margaret_anderson">Miss Anderson:</persName></salute></opener>
            <p>I have just received your nice letter and I am writing at once to beg you to be sure to let me know when you are coming to <placeName key="boston">Boston</placeName>. I did plan to go to <placeName key="nyc">New York</placeName> next week, but I can do that either the beginning or the end of the week as it is a business trip to see my publishers. I have not made any definite arrangements with them yet and could arrange to go at any time which would not make me lose the pleasure of seeing you, so do make your plans soon and let me know them so that we may not miss each other.</p>
            <p>I have a great many things I should like to say to you and you can imagine that I should be glad to shake the hand of the person who has been so appreciative about my work.</p>
            <p><persName key="richard_aldington">Richard Aldington</persName>, whose work you know, wrote me a letter the other day and asked me whether you would like to have a translation of one of <persName key="remy_gourmant">Remy de Gourmond’s</persName> things which he has made. I think he
            <pb n="2">
            that [sic]<!--transcription added sic, not sure what it is supposed to say--> it is a labor of love on his part and an endeavor to do all he can to help along the good work which you wish to do. Personally I think anything from Remy de Gourmond’s pen will add much to the prestige of your <title key="littleReview" level="j">magazine</title>, and I also think that Richard Aldington is one of the very most delightful prose writers as well as a poet whom we have, and if you can attach him to your regular contributors I think you will have done an excellent thing for yourself and a very good thing for him.</p>
            <p>We can talk about all this when I see you.</p>
            <p>Please do not let me fail to do that <date when="1914-10-12">next week</date>.</p>
            <closer>Yours very sincerely,</closer>
