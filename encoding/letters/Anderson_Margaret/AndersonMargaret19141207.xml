            <p>I am very glad indeed you are going to take <title key="allies" level="a">“The Allies,”</title> as it is a poem to which I am attached. But indeed you are wrong about <title level="a">“The Footmen”</title> – I consider it one of the best things I have done at all, although I can quite understand that it may not be popular.</p>
            <p>You puzzle me a little by telling me that you longed to keep all the short poems, and then send them all back. Does that mean that you would really like them for a later number, or that you would like to use them and cannot?</p>
            <p>I expect to be in <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName> the end of this week. As soon as I know definitely, I will wire you. I shall bring a number of poems under my arm, like a drummer, and you can choose from among them what you would like for some future issue. I wish I could tell you definitely now about my coming, but I am waiting for a wire from a friend of mine with whom I must connect and who is coming through from the West.</p>
            <closer>Yours truly,</closer>
            <!--this is on the bottom of the letter, not sure what to with it ?-->
            Miss Margaret Anderson,
            917 Fine Arts Building,
            Chicago, Illinois.
