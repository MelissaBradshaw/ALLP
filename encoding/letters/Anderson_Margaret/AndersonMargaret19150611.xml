             <salute>My dear <persName key="margaret_anderson">Miss Anderson</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>I am awfully sorry about your being so low in funds; but I suppose now it is just like pouring money into a bottomless pit. I send you a <measure type="currency" quantity="10">ten-dollar bill</measure>, to make up for the subscribers I have not the time to hunt for; and you know I will do everything for you that I possibly can.</p>
            <p>Keep yourself above water, for Heaven sake! I think all of us would feel it as a great loss, if the <title key="littleReview" level="j">magazine</title> were to stop. I have an idea! Why don’t you ask every poet or prose writer who has ever written for you, or with whom you are in any way connected, to send you a copy of their books, autographed with an interesting inscription, and then auction them off somewhere at some fair? They are trying this, collecting autograph copies, at <!--brown university or somewhere in boston?-->Brown’s Bookshop here, and they expect to sell the books afterwards as a collection; but that would be too slow a business for you. You would make some money anyway, and I do not believe there is a writer who would not be glad to help you in this way. If 
            <pb n="2">
            you like my suggestion, let me know, and I will send you my <title key="swordBladesAndPoppySeed" level="m">book</title>, done up for sale.
            Good luck to you anyway, and do not lose courage!
            <closer>Sincerely yours,</closer>
