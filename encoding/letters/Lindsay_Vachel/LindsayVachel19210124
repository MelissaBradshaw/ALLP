                </opener>
                <p>Your letter of <date when="1921-01-03">January 3rd</date> has been waiting to be answered while I waited to cope with
                    the slow movement of convalescence, and much
                    work which has accumulated. You know, or
                    perhaps you do not know, that I had another <rs key="medical" type="theme">operation</rs> very recently which makes my second in
                    eight months, and it takes some time to pull up from things of that sort.</p>
                <p>I have read your <title>“Golden Book of Springfield”</title> with the greatest interest, and should have
                liked to review it very much if it were not that I am doing no reviewing just now because of my
                        <title key="legends">new book</title> which is coming out in <date when="1921-04">April</date>, and because of the operation which made me unable to
                        do anything for some months. I am awfully sorry, therefore, that I cannot come out in print at the
                        moment, but I have had to tell my papers, the <title key="times">"Times"</title> and the
                        <title key="nyEveningPost">“Post,”</title> that I could write nothing for them until the late Spring. I am afraid you have not exactly rung the right bell with me when
                        you mention <persName>Mrs. Eddy's</persName> <title>“Science and Health.”</title> My feelings about Mrs. Eddy are beyond words,
                        and I should hate to compare your book with hers.</p>
                        <p>I care more for your book on the imaginative side than I do on the practical side, as you
                        must know would be my natural reaction. I thought <persName key="william_benet">Benét's</persName> review of it in the “Post” was
                            excellent and felt you must be pleased.</p>
                            <p>I also have to thank you for your book of pictures which came a long time ago, but so
                                soon before my operation that I could not thank you
                                then. The things I knew I liked as much as I did before, and I was interested to see the new things.
                            Personally, I am devoted to your pictures, so I
                            <pb>n="2"</pb>
                            hope you will go on and issue another number with new pictures to new poems.</p>
                            <p>Now as to <persName>Mr. Squire</persName>, the difficulty is that Squire does not like me. I do not know that he
                                knows much about me, but he has written some rather scathing things in which he speaks of me
                                as <quote type="english">“a terrible Amazon.”</quote> I admire Squire's energy very much, and like some of his poetry,
                                although I have never seen a copy of his <title>“New Mercury,”</title> but I should like very much to do
                                something for him. I do not, however, know just what I can do. <placeName key="boston">Boston</placeName> is not like the West. They
                                do not care much for lectures here, and I think Squire is not much known. Evidently your
                                propaganda on his behalf has had some effect, for <persName key="john_lowes">Professor Lowes</persName> told me that he had heard
                                from <persName key="henry_canby">Mr. Canby</persName> about Squire's coming.</p>
                                <p>Last year I succeeded in persuading the <orgName key="poetryClubNewEngland">New England Poetry Club</orgName> and the <orgName>Harvard
                                Poetry Club</orgName> to join and support <persName>Sassoon</persName>, and I have put out a little feeler to the same effect in
                                regard to Squire. They tell me that Squire will not put himself under any lecture agency so that
                                his goings and comings are a little uncertain, and as <persName key="conrad_aiken">Conrad Aiken</persName> hates me even worse than
                                Squire can be presumed to do, I am not in a position to find out anything from him. You will
                                think that I live surrounded by enemies; that is hardly true, but it is funny that you should have
                                pitched on me and should have given Conrad Aiken as a sort of general information, under the
                                circumstances. I do not know what is the matter with Aiken. People tell me that he is very bitter
                                and acrid about everything. I never met him but once, but evidently that once was enough. He
                                has jumped on me time and again in his criticisms, and from various things he has said about me
                                I have felt that it was best to steer clear of him. Therefore, I have never communicated with him 
                                in any way and cannot now. If you can find out from him when Mr. Squire arrives, I 
                                <pb>n="3"</pb>
                                will do what I can, as I feel no hostility whatever on account of his attitude.</p>
                                <p>I do wish the politics of poetry could be done away with. I hate these vituperations of one
                                poet against another. Criticism is one thing, personal abuse is a different matter entirely. The
                                former can exist with perfect friendship, the latter makes all personal intercourse practically
                                impossible. You will, therefore, see how difficult it is, but if you will let me know when you
                                think Squire is likely to be in <placeName key="usa">America</placeName>, I will fish round and see what I can do.</p>
                                <p>I do not think that you and I are in such disagreement as you feel. Much of your work I
                                greatly admire, and what I do not admire I say frankly and honestly to you personally as well as
                                of you, and neither you nor I have that deplorable habit of calling personal names. As a man, I
                                like and admire you, and with much of your poetry I am in perfect accord, and where we
                                disagree, at least we can do so honestly and without feeling. You have managed to steer clear of
                                the cliques and quarrels of the business; I have not been so fortunate. Stupid of me perhaps,
                                perhaps owing to circumstances which I cannot help. However, you can be sure that I shall do
                                everything in my power for Squire, if he doesn't bite my head off before I begin.</p>
                                <p>With the best of good wishes,</p>
                         <closer>Very sincerely yours,</closer>
