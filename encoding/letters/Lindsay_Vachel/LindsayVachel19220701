                    <salute>Dear <persName key="vachel_lindsay">Vachel Lindsay</persName>:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Thank you a thousand times for this letter. It will make all the difference to my
                sojourn in <placeName key="springfield">Springfield</placeName>. I will write to <persName>the lady</persName> when I know the date of my visit.
                It is not to be decided until the middle of the summer, as I have told everybody who
                wants me to speak that I cannot make dates until I have got ahead somewhat with
                <title key="johnKeats">Keats</title>, and I do not want to bother your friend until I know definitely when I shall
                be in Springfield. It will be a great pleasure to see them and I only hope they will
                like my reading, for it is a reading which I am going to give there, before some
                Woman's Club or other, I think. </p>
                <p>I have enjoyed so much my little glimpses of you
                this year, and I wish you would come to these parts oftener. Next time you come you
                must remind me to show you my Egyptian kodaks, which I do think are an interesting
                collection although I do say so.</p>
                <p>I remember the mention of your <persName>friends'</persName> daughter in <persName>Mr. Graham's</persName> <title>book</title>. I do not
                quite know what <persName>Mr. Allen</persName> could put into his column about me, but perhaps he will
                know better than I. At any rate, there will be time for that when I know when I am
                going.</p>
                <p>I am afraid you are having a hot week for your museum feast. I wish we could wander
                round the museum together. It was fun talking about those pictures the other night.</p>
                <p>The best of good luck to your Summer, and whatever work you do during it.</p>
                <closer>Very sincerely yours,</closer>
