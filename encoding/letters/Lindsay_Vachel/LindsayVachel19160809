            <salute>My dear <persName key="vachel_lindsay">Mr. Lindsay</persName>:</salute></opener>
                <p>Your letter came last week, and yesterday came your pamphlet forwarded from <placeName>
                Brookline</placeName>. It is an interesting experiment you are trying. I shall be anxious to see how it pans
                out. The unfortunate few of us who combine talking and writing need something to explain to
                people what we are trying to do, and save us from explaining ourselves at the beginning of every
                lecture. I thank you very much for your kind mention of me. I hope you never heard me read
                <title>“The Kallyope Yell.”</title> I should hate to attempt anything of the sort with you in the audience. It is
                the palest possible reflection of what I believe to be your own manner, although I have never
                heard you recite that particular poem. The Lord gave me no such superb organ as yours with
                which to do my talking. However, I ha' done my best, such as it is.</p>
                <p>Your little paragraph about the <orgName key="imagists">Imagists</orgName> is fair and true. There is plenty of room in art for
                your theories and ours. I do not see why we cannot run along side by side, and go our own ways
                with much enthusiasm and admiration for each other's.</p>
                <p>I am immensely taken with your censer swinging over <placeName key="springfield">Springfield</placeName>. Those illustrations are
                so full of swing and imagination! Cannot you persuade <orgName key="macmillan">Macmillan</orgName> to bring you out with
                illustrations done by yourself sometime? It would make a splendid book.</p>
                <p>I shall certainly hope to see you when you are in the East next <date when="1915-02">February</date>. But why isn't it
                in <date when="1915-01">January</date>, as I have to be in <placeName key="nyc">New York</placeName> most of January talking myself. In February I expect to
                be back again 
                <pb n="2"></pb>
                in <placeName key="boston">Boston</placeName>, and probably you will turn up there, in which case we shall certainly
                see each other, for you will let me know when you come, won't you?</p>
                <p>With best of luck,</p>
                <closer>Sincerely yours,</closer>
