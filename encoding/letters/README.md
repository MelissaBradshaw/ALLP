# Encoded Letters

Each recipient should have their own folder with XML files of their encoded letters. Note that transcriptions and image files exist on Dropbox. 

### File Names
The standardized file name for each letter will be without any punctuation, and consist of [Last Name][FirstName][Year][Month][Day]. Therefore, the letter from Amy Lowell to Ellery Sedgwick on September 29, 1914, will be referred to as:
  - ```SedgwickEllery19140929.jpeg```
    - If multiple images, append a number + underscore at the beginning of the file name (```1_SedgwickEllery19140929.jpeg```)
  - ```SedgwickEllery19140929.doc```
  - ```SedgwickEllery19140929.xml```
