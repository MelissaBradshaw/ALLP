# Encoded Letters

Each letter should exist in its own folder, which will contain:
1. Image files (.jpeg, .pdf)
2. Transcription with editorial notes (.docx)
3. The encoded letter (.xml).

### File Names
The standardized file name for each letter will be without any punctuation, and consist of [Last Name][FirstName][Year][Month][Day]. Therefore, the letter from Amy Lowell to Ellery Sedgwick on September 29, 1914, will be referred to as:
  - ```SedgwickEllery19140929.jpeg```
    - If multiple images, append a number + underscore at the beginning of the file name (```1_SedgwickEllery19140929.jpeg```)
  - ```SedgwickEllery19140929.doc```
  - ```SedgwickEllery19140929.xml```
