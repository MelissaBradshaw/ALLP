<salute>My dear <persName key="mary_aldis">Mrs. Aldis</persName>:</salute></opener>
<p>You must think me fearfully rude to have apparently disappeared during your visit to <placeName key="boston">Boston</placeName>! As a matter of fact, I did disappear—that was just the trouble.</p>
<p>When your son telephoned over that you would not be able to dine with me on <date when="1916-04-23">Sunday</date>, I cannot tell you how disappointed I was. But, unfortunately, I went away immediately to <placeName key="newYork">New York</placeName>, and when I got back I telephoned out to your son’s rooms and found that you and he had already gone to <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName>. I meant to write to you from New York, but I was in such a rush while I was there that I never found a moment to put pen to paper. I am sorry. I had looked forward to your visit, and it was a shame that it should have coincided with my absence.</p>
<p>I read an account of your plays at <orgName key="littleTheatre">The Little Theatre</orgName> which sounded most enthusiastic.</p>
<closer>Very sincerely yours</closer>,
