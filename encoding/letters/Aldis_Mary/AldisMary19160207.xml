<salute>My dear <persName key="mary_aldis">Mrs. Aldis</persName>:</salute></opener>
<p>What a brick you are! And how kind you have been to take such a lot of trouble on my behalf. I have telegraphed to <persName key="edmund_browne">Mr. Browne</persName> that the <date when="1916-03-19">19th of March</date> would be the best date for me. It is awfully kind of you to want me to wait until <date when="1916-04">April</date>, and go to you at <placeName key="lakeForest">Lake Forest</placeName>, but I am afraid I must get out there as quickly as possible, and I do not really know why I should not go out again later, if you think well enough of <title level="a">“The Grocery”</title> to produce it at your <orgName key="littleTheatre">theatre</orgName>.</p>
<p>I do hope you are coming to <placeName key="boston">Boston</placeName> the end of this week. Why don’t you come to the <palceName key="sevenels">Hotel Lowell</palceName>? It is quite centrally situated, with automobile accommodation back and forth from the city. Of course, I know you have a sister-in-law living very near here, but sisters-in-law are like the poor, they are always with us; they will keep for an indefinite period. I believe your son is in <placeName key="cambridge">Cambridge</placeName>, and I must admit that we are not right beside Cambridge; but with the automobile accommodation I mentioned, it only takes fifteen minutes longer to get there. I do hope I shall hear from you, to say that you are coming, and coming here.</p>
<closer>Sincerely yours</closer>,
