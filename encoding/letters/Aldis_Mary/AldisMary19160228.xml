<salute>My dear <persName key="mary_aldis">Mrs. Aldis</persName>:</salute></opener>
<p>Your play has safely arrived, but I have not had time to read it yet. I shall do so, however, as soon as possible, and I feel sure that I have a rare treat in front of me.</p>
<p>I was on the point of sending you <title level="a">“The Grocery Shop”</title>, and I am very glad that you found it. I will bring a copy of <title key="turnpike" level="a">“Off The Turnpike”</title> with me when I come to <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName>.</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear that <persName key="el_masters">Mr.</persName> and <persName key="helen_jenkins">Mrs. Masters</persName> will be at your house at lunch—and <persName key="arthur_ficke">Mr. Ficke</persName>, too. I cannot think of anybody else whom I should like to meet,—I am sure that anybody you invite will be most agreeable to me, or nobody more than you’ve got. It seems to me a charming party as it is.</p>
<p>I am particularly glad that your paper on <rs key="imagism" type="movement">Imagism</rs> went well. Feeling does run rather high, but I think, on the whole, it is a good thing.</p>
<p>I will write you again more fully when I have read your play. In the meanwhile,</p>
<closer>Very sincerely yours</closer>,

         <note target="#n1" resp="mb">Helen Jenkins was the wife of Edgar Lee Masters from 1898-1923. At the time this letter was written, Lowell would have been referring to Helen Jenkins when referencing Mrs. Masters.</note>
