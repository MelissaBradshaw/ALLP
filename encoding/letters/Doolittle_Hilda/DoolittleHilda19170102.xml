            <salute>Dear <persName key="hilda_doolittle">Hilda</persName>:</salute></opener>
         <p>I am sorry to hear that <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName> has already gone. He wrote me a letter, which I just
            received, saying that when I got it he would be in <placeName key="france">France</placeName>. You must be fearfully lonely,
            and I wish I were with you to give what little comfort I could.</p>
         <p>Should you decide to come to <placeName key="usa">America</placeName>, please let me know at once, for I shall want to
            see you as soon as possible. I am going on to <placeName key="nyc">New York</placeName> on Wednesday, to be there three
            weeks, so if you come soon, I may be able to meet you.</p>
         <p>You know I am lecturing about you at the <placeName key="brooklynInstitute">Brooklyn Institute of Fine Arts and Sciences</placeName>.
            You never answered my letter requesting a slight biography, so I was obliged to write to
            <persName key="helen_doolittle">your mother</persName>, who gave me merely the barest facts, as, she said, you were always so
            reticent about yourself. I do wish you would give me some anecdotes, though, which I can
            work in when the book is published. All the other poets I have spoken to have done so,
            and I think it makes things interesting. There are four lectures, which are to be
            divided as follows:</lb> 1. <persName key="ea_robinson">Edwin Arlington Robinson</persName></lb> 2. <persName key="robert_frost">Robert Frost</persName></lb> 3. <persName key="el_masters">Edgar Lee Masters</persName> and <persName key="carl_sandburg">Carl Sandburg</persName></lb> 4. <persName key="john_fletcher">John Gould Fletcher</persName> and H.D.,</lb> and I hope to be able to do you justice.</p>
         <p>I have read your book through with the feeling of greatest envy and admiration. No one
            of us is so perfect in technique as you; and the beauty of your work never ceases to
            satisfy me. I only hope that these lectures and the book may be a means of making more
            people</pb> understand you than do now. The public is a stupid beast.</p>
         <p>I have sent some of Richard’s poems to "<title key="sevenArts">The Seven Arts</title>", and I hope they will accept
            some. <persName key="brown">Brown</persName> still owes Richard <measure type="currency" num="$5">five dollars</measure> on my agreement. He told me he would pay me
            last week, but, of course, it has not come. I probably shall get it, however, before
            long.</p>
         <closer>Keep me informed as to Richard’s movements, and your own, please, and believe me,
            Always affectionately,</closer>
      </body>
