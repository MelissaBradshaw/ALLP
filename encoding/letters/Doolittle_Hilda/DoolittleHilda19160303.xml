            <salute>My dear <persName key="hilda_doolittle">Hilda</persName>:</salute></opener>
         <p>Your royalties were <measure type="currency" num="73.02">$73.02</measure>, which makes $36.51 apiece for you and <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName>. You will find that I did not add a great deal to the money I sent you. By all means, keep it as a fund for your poor artists; or, better still, as a fund in case the submarine warfare makes the arrival of funds from <placeName key="usa">America</placeName> really difficult.</p> 
         <p><persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher</persName> has not said anything to me about going abroad. I don’t believe he will, unless the maritime situation clears up. Feeling is running rather high here just now; but I think you would be pleased with it if you were here. What I wrote Richard about America’s neutral attitude applies to the country at large – not to the section of it to which I, and others like me, belong.</p> 
         <p><persName key="fs_flint">Flint</persName> has bowed to our decision about "Evil", and has asked me to put in "War-time" instead. Of course, it comes very late, and the book is in the press; but I shall do my best to get it in.</p>
         <p>This is not much of a letter, because – you will be glad to hear – my "<title key="sixFrenchPoets">Six French Poets</title>" has already gone through its first edition, and I am very busy preparing a second one; and also getting ready <title key="menWomenGhosts"><!--I assume: should check-->my next volume of poems</title>, to come out in the Autumn.</p> 
         <p>Yes, the lectures are going very well, and I think the people are paying more attention to imagism every day – at least, they no longer consider it the attitude of imbeciles and charlatans only. I think next Autumn I may extend my lecture tour a little further afield. <persName key="ec_marsh">Mr. Marsh</persName> says he can tell from the sale of my books where I have been, and I think that is equally true of the "<title key="some_imagist_poets">Anthology</title>", for I bring you</pb> all in the course of my lecture.</p> 
         <p>This is a very short letter because I am fearfully busy. I will write again in a few days, more at length.</p> 
         <p>I was asked out the other day to address a number of <placeName key="harvard">Harvard</placeName> students on the subject, so you can see that the interest is spreading.</p> 
         <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
