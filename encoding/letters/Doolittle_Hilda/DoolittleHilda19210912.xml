            <salute>Dear <persName key="hilda_doolittle">Hilda</persName>:</salute></opener>
         <p>This is only a hurried scrawl to send off your half-yearly royalties on the "<title key="some_imagist_poets">Imagist Poets</title>." They should have gone before, but I have been frightfully busy getting 
            Mrs. <persName key="florence_ayscough">Ayscough</persName>’s and my <title key="firFlowerTablets">book of Chinese translations</title> into the press, and I am equally
            breathless in my efforts to get it out again. But I cannot hold this cheque any longer;
            vast though it is, my conscience says it ought to go to you.</p>
         <p>I hear from <persName key="winifred_bryher">Winifred</persName> on occasion. It is too bad that they have refused her book. I
            wonder when yours is coming out. I have preempted it for the "<title key="nyEveningPost">New York Evening Post</title>,"
            but I have seen no announcements of it and I have no idea when it is due.</p>
         <p>Since my operation, my work has been confined to these Chinese things, but once that
            book is out of the way, I shall tackle <persName key="john_keats">Keats</persName> in earnest. My lectures begin in November,
            but I feel better than I have for a long time and, although I do not permit myself to
            hope that I am cured, at any rate I am having a pleasant respite.</p>
         <p>Where are you and what are you doing? I long to hear. And how is <persName key="perdita_aldington">Perdita</persName>? I have no time
            for a longer letter, but you will know that this takes much love from both <persName key="ada_russell">Mrs. Russell</persName>
            and me.</p>
         <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
         <p>Enclosure.</p>
