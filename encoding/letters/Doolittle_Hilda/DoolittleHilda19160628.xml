            <salute>Dear <persName key="hilda_doolittle">Hilda</persName>:</salute></opener>
        <p> I enclose a letter to <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName>, which I have left open on purpose, so that you can read it before you send it on to him. It is, of course, to you both.</p>
         <p>I am awfully sorry that you cannot do the <placeName key="london">London</placeName> "chronique" while he is gone, but I perfectly understand why that would be impossible; and, as you will see by my letter to him, <persName key="ws_braithwaite">Braithwaite</persName> will keep the place open for him.</p> 
         <p>I know you are fearfully lonely, my Dear. I wish I were anywhere near, it would be so good if <persName key="ada_russell">Ada</persName> and I could drop in on ou at intervals and cheer you up, and it would be so good for us to have you near by. But you are a brave woman, Hilda, and a good poet, and I believe those two qualities are the ones necessary to make a great artist. I have no words to describe my admiration for your poems. As I wrote Richard, they are exquisite and they are strong, and I think they will do a great deal to make people understand your work who did not quite get it in your smaller pieces, for no one can resist the human force, the tragic, awe-inspiring quality of these poems, even the people who know nothing of technique.</p> 
         <p>I am going to try to write to you and Richard very often while he is away. Shall I send his letters to you, or direct to him? I am sure you will see <persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher</persName> before long, as it was one of his chief reasons for going to <placeName key="england">England</placeName>.</p> 
         <closer>With lots of love,</closer>
               </body>
