            By Sales</lb>
            19 Imagist Poets .67-1/2 $12.32</lb>

            I should have sent them in August, and I feel very guilty that I did not do so. Nothing
            but the smallness of the sum seems to excuse my dilatoriness, but the truth is I have
            been so drowned in this <title key="johnKeats"><persName key="john_keats">Keats</persName> book</title> that I have hardly gotten out of it for a moment. You
            will forgive me, won’t you?</p>
         <p>I do not know where you are or what you are doing. Do write and tell me about
            everything, and do let me know where <persName key="winifred_bryher">Winifred Bryher</persName> is. I sent her a whole batch of
            unpublished poems the other day – really about two months ago – and I have not heard a
            word from her to say that she has received it. I sent it as usual to <placeName key="audleyStreet">South Audley Street</placeName>, where she always tells me to address her as the surest place. I suppose she has
            gone to the <placeName key="parnirs">Parnirs</placeName>, of the <placeName key="southSeaIslands">South Sea Islands</placeName>, or the <placeName key="northPole">North Pole</placeName>, or somewhere, and the
            package is awaiting her return home. Whatever you know about here, do tell me, and
            tell me everything you are doing. I understand that <orgName key="houghton_mifflin">Houghton Mifflin</orgName> are to issue your
            books next year; at least, so <persName key="ferris_greenslet">Ferris Greenslet</persName> told me a little while ago. I shall be
            delighted to have them in print, for I should like to send a number of copies around for
            Christmas.</p>
         <p>There is precious little news here. I have been hard at work all Summer over my <title key="johnKeats"><persName key="john_keats">Keats</persName> book</title>, and have hardly been away from home. I have just been in <placeName key="nyc">New York</placeName> for two weeks,
            and am going there again next week to give some lectures, but I am minimizing my
            lectures this year in order that I may</pb> devote all my time to Keats. Getting
            him through the press will prevent my going abroad this Summer, and sometimes it really
            seems as though I should never go abroad again; but, of course, I know that is not true,
            I might just possess my soul in patience.</p>
         <p>I am awfully anxious to hear all about you. It seems so long since I have had a letter,
            and I hate to get out of touch with you. It is one of the advantages of the Imagist
            anthologies that I have to send the royalties to you every six months. Lots of love, my
            dear, from both <persName key="ada_russell">Ada</persName> and me, and write soon.</p>
         <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
