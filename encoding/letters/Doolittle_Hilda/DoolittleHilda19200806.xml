            <salute>Dear <persName key="hilda_doolittle">Hilda</persName>:</salute></opener>
         <p>Your book has come, and I think it very fine and make no doubt I can place it somewhere
            satisfactorily, but not, I fear, until I go to <placeName key="nyc">New
            York</placeName>.</p>
         <p>I hear from <persName key="winifred_bryher">Winifred Ellerman</persName> that you are
            sailing on the Adriatic on the <date when="1920-09-01">first of September</date>. She
            seems to think that you are going on to <placeName key="california"
               >California</placeName>; but, from your letter to me, I presume you are going to stay
            a little while with your <persName key="helen_doolittle">mother</persName> in <placeName
               key="philadelphia">Philadelphia</placeName> first. Now it occurs to me that Winifred
            may be a little awkward to place during the visit to your mother. I should like to ask
            her to come to me for a week or so, but I cannot tell how I shall be, my health is so
            precarious. We can tell when you arrive.</p>
         <p>I am contemplating meeting you in New York, as perhaps the services of somebody on the
            spot will make your landing a little easier. It depends upon my health which is rather
            nasty. New York is fearfully crowded, and I think it would be well for you to authorize
            me to engage rooms for you (or engage them yourself), which you can step into on
            landing, as you cannot go round from hotel to hotel looking for accommodations with a
               <persName key="perdita_aldington">baby</persName> in tow.</p>
         <p>Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you. Perhaps there will be some
            of your family on hand to meet you, but if there is anything I can do, you may be sure
            that you can ask me to do it. I must see you before you go to California, at any rate.
            It will be such a pleasure to be with you again. I will not write any more now, for I
            want this letter to catch you before you sail. I do not know just when the Adriatic is
            due, but I will find that out. <foreign xml:lang="fr">Au revoir</foreign>, then,
               <foreign xml:lang="fr">à bientôt</foreign>.</p>
         <closer>With a great deal of love from both <persName key="ada_russell">Mrs. Russell</persName> and me, 
            Affectionately yours,</closer>
