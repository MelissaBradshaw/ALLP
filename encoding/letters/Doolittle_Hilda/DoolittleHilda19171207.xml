            <salute>Dear <persName key="hilda_doolittle">Hilda</persName>:-</salute></opener>
         <p>I was very glad indeed to get your letter of <date when="1917-11-14">November 14th</date>, and to know that you liked
            the essay on yourself in "<title key="tendencies">Tendencies</title>." I think none of the essays in the book has been
            so well taken as that one, and I hope that it will stimulate interest in your poetry. A
            good many people have told me that after reading my book they felt they wanted to go and
            read the authors themselves, and I only trust that this laudable desire will bear
            fruit.</p>
         <p><persName key="helen_doolittle">Your mother</persName> wrote me how much she liked it, and she said something else that gave me
            even greater pleasure which was that it seemed like you; it almost startled her she felt
            it was so true a description of your personality. To my mind, nothing could be higher
            praise than that, except that Richard, who knows you better than anybody, liked the
            account of your work. I do not suppose that no matter what I said about you as a person
            I could satisfy him, and quite rightly, but I like to think that it has been my
            privilege to be the first person to represent you to the world in toto your work and
            yourself.</p>
         <p>Your letter came two or three days ago, and Richardâ€™s of the <date when="1917-11-18">18th</date> came just now. I am
            answering his letter on a separate sheet enclosed. It is really for both of you, of
            course, but he said so many things I wanted to answer that I thought I would do it this
            way. What you may say about the Lawrences is perfectly horrible. I feel very sorry for
            them, and I will send you some money for them in a little while. I think it better to
            send to you for various reasons, among others, that as they cannot forever live in your
            room, I shall not know their address until you send it to me. I want</pb> to think it over
            for a few days and see what I can send them, and then I will send you a draft, which you
            can turn over to them. I am still addressing you at <placeName key="mechlenburgSquare">Mechlenburg Square</placeName>, as I suppose it
            will be forwarded to you at <placeName key="litchfield">Litchfield</placeName>, and I do not know your address there, and
            Richard says that he will be through with the training school in a couple of weeks and
            then I suppose you will have to move.</p>
         <p>This is not much of a letter. I am just sending it off to acknowledge yours, but it
            takes a great deal of love from both <persName key="ada_russell">Mrs. Russell</persName> and me.</p>
