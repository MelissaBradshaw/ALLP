                    <salute>My dear<persName key="eunice_tietjens"></persName>Mrs. Tietjens</salute>:</opener>
                <p>I am horrified to discover that in that <title key="bookshelfOfModernPoets" level="s">list of poetry books</title> that I made out for <title key="doubledayPageCompany">Doubleday,
                    Page &amp; Company</title>, <title key="profilesFromChina" level="m">Profiles from China</title>," which I 
                    especially included, has been omitted. The reason for this is that the book is out of print—at least so 
                    <persName>Mr. Seymour</persName><anchor xml:id="n1"/> reports—and <persName key="a_knopf">Alfred 
                        Knopf</persName> says that he is to issue a new edition, but it is not yet ready. I have wrestled hard with 
                    <persName key="cedric_crowell">Mr. Crowell</persName>, who is the head of the <orgName  
                        key="lordAndTaylorBookShop">Lord and Taylor Book Shop</orgName>, and he has just written regretting very 
                    much that “Profiles from China” was left out of the first publicity list, but says that it shall be included in 
                    subsequent ones. Feeling as I do about that book, the idea of having any list come out without it is horrible to me, 
                    and in case you might see the list, I wish it clearly understood what was the reason of the omission.</p>
                <p>I hope that all is going well with you. I think that I may go through <placeName 
                    key="chicago">Chicago</placeName> on my way back from <placeName key="grand_rapids">Grand 
                        Rapids</placeName> where I am lecturing this Autumn, in which case I hope that I may see you.</p>

                        <label>P.S.</label> In reading over this letter, it seems to me that I have put it as though Mr. Crowell left the
                        book out of his list for any reason but the true one. You understand, he is as eager as I to list it,
                        but as we were only printing procurable books, he felt it could not go on, until we got a date of
                        republication from Mr. Knopf. He is an energetic and enthusiastic publisher, Knopf<choice>.</choice> I told him
