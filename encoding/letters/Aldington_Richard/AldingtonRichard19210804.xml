                        <p>This letter consists of four typed pages on carbon paper. The upper left
                            corner of the first page contains an address line. The upper right of
                            each page contains a dateline. The third page is damaged along the right
                            side of the paper as it seems to have been crumbling. The fourth page
                            has some of the same damage alongside the right edge. Each page after
                            the first has a heading above the dateline (Mr. Aldington - [Page #]).

                    <salute>Dear <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName>:</salute></opener>
                    <p>You must think me very strange never to have written to you after getting the
                    letter telling me of <persName key="albert_aldington">your father</persName>'s sudden death; but, as <persName key="ada_russell">Mrs. Russell</persName> has
                    written you, I had to have another <rs key="medical" type="theme">operation</rs>, which makes three in fifteen
                    months. It was impossible for me to write anything - even dictate anything. I
                    have thought of you so often, and only wish that I had been nearer and could do
                    anything for you in person. The breaking up of old ties, even if one has not
                    lived with one's parents for years, is a dreadful thing.</p>
                    <p>I sent you a copy of my new volume, “<title key="legends">Legends</title>,” which I was unable to write in,
                    as I only received it about two days after my operation. I wonder if you ever
                    got it. My secretaries think that it was sent to <placeName key="malthouseCottage">Malthouse Cottage</placeName>, Padworth,
                    Reading, Berks, but they may have sent it to your old address, <placeName key="authorsClub">The Author's
                    Club</placeName>. If you never received the book, I will send you another. I cannot think
                    that you will like it particularly. It is perhaps too much in my own particular
                    idiom to give you much pleasure; by which I mean that I think your taste runs
                    toward a more peaceful type of verse.</p>
                    <p><persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet Monroe</persName> tells me that you have resigned as her foreign correspondent,
                    telling her that you found yourself getting more conservative as you grew older;
                    if so, it is interesting. I do not find any such thing in myself. I dislike
                    freaks as much as I ever did, but I dearly love evolutionary experiments.</p>
                    <p>I have a volume of Chinese translations - which I am doing with my friend <persName key="florence_ayscough">Mrs.
                    Francis Ayscough</persName> of <placeName key="shanghai">Shanghai</placeName>, <placeName key="china">China</placeName> - coming out this <date when="1921">Autumn</date>. Of course these
                    innumerable operations have taken a great deal of my strength,<pb n="02"/> and I have not
                    been able to do as much work as I should like, in consequence, but I am getting
                    round again, and it looks as if this one might be successful, but then, it has
                    looked that way before, one really cannot tell, and nothing but time can give us
                    any idea as to whether it has been successful or not. The <date when="1921">Summer</date> has been spent
                    mostly in an arm-chair trying to get up strength. I crawl round the garden a
                    little; and, by the way, that description of yours of the hill opposite your
                    house is too lovely, with all its beautiful flowers. I wish you could see my
                    garden. It is not wild, merely a garden, but I am devotedly fond of it and
                    manage to keep it in bloom from <date when="1921-04">April</date> to <date when="1921-10">November</date>.</p>
                    <p>My present plans are to finish my “<title key="johnKeats" level="m">Life of Keats</title>” this <date when="1921">Winter</date>, put it through
                    the press before I leave, and sail for <placeName key="england">England</placeName> sometime <date when="1922">next Spring or early
                    Summer</date>; that is, supposing this operation is successful. There is so much
                    suppose about this that I have not engaged my passages yet, but if all goes well
                    by <date when="1922-01">January</date> I think I shall. You say that you think I should keep criticism and
                    biography apart in my “Life of Keats,” but that is not exactly my idea, although
                    perhaps we may mean nearer the same thing than it sounds as if we did. I want to
                    give a more comprehending and psychological biography than has ever yet been
                    done of him. I agree with you entirely that a great deal of his work is very,
                    very poor. The rest of it is pure genius. That I hope to point out. Of course I
                    shall pick out the things that I think are genius, and not the things that the
                    world does necessarily. For instance, I have no use for the “<title key="hyperion" level="a">Hyperion</title>” in either
                    form, and many people consider it his best work. Again I think “<title key="eveOfMark" level="a">The Eve of St.
                    Mark</title>” a marvellous (sic) thing, and only a very few critics have given it any
                    consideration whatever. But there will be a great deal of biography. I am having
                    an awful time with<pb n="03"/> some curmudgeons over here who have original documents that
                    they will not allow me to use. I speak as if there were millions of these men;
                    on the contrary, there are only two. Most of the people who have manuscripts are
                    only too glad to put them at my disposal. Since writing my centenary address at
                    <orgName key="yale">Yale</orgName> <date when="1920">last Winter</date>, I have done nothing but collect material for my biography. I
                    do not intend to do anything about getting the thing together or starting
                    writing until I get this Chinese book off my hands. Then, in November, my
                    lectures begin again, and it is no little problem to fit them in in nice tidy
                    packages and have plenty of time in between the layers of lectures to do the
                    Keats book, so you see I am busy.</p>
                    <p>And you, I imagine, are extremely busy too, judging from Harriet Monroe's
                    account of your letter to her. What has happened to <persName key="fs_flint">Flint</persName>? I never received a
                    word from him, after I wrote him as you asked me to do after his wife's death. I
                    have never even received any acknowledgement from him of having received the
                    money that I sent through you. I am sending you two drafts for the half-year
                    <title key="someImagistPoets" level="m">anthology</title> royalties, one for him again. I wish those little books would go out
                    of print. I think the time for them is past, and they will be of more interest
                    collected with great labour at second hand by enthusiasts; but they seem to have
                    a great many sheets on hand, and they keep selling, as you see. Of course they
                    will have to be sold while the printers have them to sell. I have ordered them
                    not to reprint, as you know.</p>
                    <p>I see many pleasant things in the papers about your “<title key="medallionsInClay" level="m">Medallions in Clay</title>,” but I
                    am puzzled to know why you cribbed your title from <persName key="henri_regnier">Henri de Régnier</persName>. Our Chinese
                    book is called “<title key="firFlowerTablets" type="m">Fir-Flower Tablets</title>,” “fir-flower” being the name of the paper on
                    which poetry was frequently written. It is an<pb n="04"/> attractive name, I think. I do not
                    know whether you ever see “<title key="dial" level="j">The Dial</title>.” There are two poems of mine in the <date when="1921-08">August</date>
                    number that I rather like.</p>
                    <p>Do write when you get this and tell me all your news, and let me know if you got
                    “Legends,” because, above all things, don't let us get out of touch just because
                    the ocean separates us and we have not met for seven years.</p>
