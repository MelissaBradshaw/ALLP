            <salute>Dear <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName>:</salute></opener>
         <p>I enclose a draft for <measure type="currency" num="200">$200.00</measure> for you to transmit to 
            <persName key="remy_gourmont">Remy de Gourmont</persName>.<anchor xml:id="n1"/>
            I do not want his Anglo Indian Land Bank Shares. I do not suppose they are of any particular value and even if
            they were I do not want to deprive him of them. This seems a very little sum to pay for
            the inspiration and knowledge I have derived from his writings. Through him I can pay
            a little of my immense debt to his nation. Will you therefore transmit it to him with
            any sort of message which you think will make it easy for him to access it. Money
            goes farther in <placeName key="france">France</placeName> than in <placeName key="usa">America</placeName> so it ought to make some little difference.</p>
         <p>We are all stuck for money over here. Dividends are not being paid and business
            concerns are shutting down. If the war continues I think of course that America will not suffer in
            the end but for the moment things are in a bad way. I came home to find my home considerably reduced 
            and I hear the same story on all sides.</p>
         <p>I have been making inquiries about a magazine which would like to have some articles by
            Remy de Gourmont. "<title key="atlantic" level="j">The Atlantic</title>" refused as “The Atlantic” always refuses everything that the
            <persName key="ellery_sedgwick">editor</persName> did not think of himself first,<anchor xml:id="n2"/> among other things I am sorry to say, the four poems of
            yours and <persName key="hilda_doolittle">Hilda's</persName> which I sent them. I have not heard from <persName key="margaret_anderson">Miss Anderson</persName> yet in regard to those
            of your poems I sent her but I do not think she will refuse them. But as I told you she pays no
            money yet so that it is of no advantage [smudged word] advantage [sic] of being always in something. I am
            awfully sorry about “The Atlantic;” it is maddening. Since <persName key="yard_robert">Mr. Yard</persName> left "<title key="century" level="j">The Century</title>" there are
            no editors of the better known magazines who have a ray of sense or taste. I have just had a
            number of my poems refused by "<title key="scribners" level="j">Scribner’s</title>." I felt sure they would refuse them but I sent them
            on the chance and they came back almost by return mail. Still I do not despair. I think it is
            merely a question of teaching the public and the later magazines will fall into line.</p>
         <p>I shall go on trying with the Remy de Gourmont suggestion until I land it somehow or
            until it is quite proven that there is nothing here which is either not already fully stocked with
            European correspondence utterly unable to appreciate this very remarkable opportunity.</p>
         <p>I have heard nothing from the <orgName key="macmillan">Macmillan Company</orgName> yet about the anthology but there is really
            nothing to worry about in that because even if they should find themselves overstocked with
            poetry for the moment I think <orgName key="houghton_mifflin">Houghton Mifflin</orgName> will undoubtedly take it. The whole interest of
            everybody is centered in the war and it is difficult to get a hearing for anything else.</p>
         <p>I am glad to know that you have got a job which helps you to feel that you are doing
            something for the country for I know how that was worrying you when I left. I cannot tell you,
            dear Richard, how loyal and splendid I think you and Hilda are about this ridiculous row which
            <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra</persName> is making over my advertisement. I cannot thank you enough and it warms my heart all
            through to feel that I have some sincere and splendid friends alty [sic].</p>
         <p>I have not seen the November <title key="poetry" level="j">“Poetry”</title> yet but I am afraid the same advertisement is appearing
            in it. I saw the proof and corrected it myself but as I did the same thing with the advertisement in
            “The Atlantic” and as they reprinted it wrong again I have no hope. The Macmillan Company
            assures me that it shall never appear after this and that the one I sent you the other day will
            appear in the December magazines. They are frightfully stupid in there and have made blunder
            after blunder but I do think I have succeeded in making them realize the seriousness of the
            situation now and that far from doing me good they will seriously injure me if they continue
            putting in this advertisement.</p>
         <p>It has been a great worry and has almost made me sick and on top of the ptomaine
            poisoning I had in <placeName key="nyc">New York</placeName> I have been pretty miserable. I wish you would explain all this to
            <persName key="ford_hueffer">Hueffer</persName>. I do not want to make enough of it to write to him but at the same time I feel that
            Ezra will do everything in his power to inflame him against me and I shall be very sorry to have that
            happen. I tried very hard to be tactful when I was in <placeName key="england">England</placeName> and to offend nobody and it is
            extremely annoying to have a blunder of the publishers upset everything.</p>
         <p>I am afraid this is rather a sad letter but I do not feel very gay. I am working very hard, so
            hard that I am a little afraid I may have to knock off for a day or two as I am getting so tired.
            Those French lectures<anchor xml:id="n3"/> mean a lot of work and so does the play,<anchor xml:id="n4"/> but after all we are just here for
            working and if I can only get through the winter without my health crashing I shall be satisfied.</p>
         <p>I will let you know just as soon as I know anything about <title key="some_imagist_poets" level="m">the anthology</title> or just as soon as
            I have landed those articles of Remy de Gourmont’s. Of course they will still have to be
            delivered in English. If you have not time to make the translation I will do it gladly for nothing.</p>
         <p>Do calm <persName key="fs_flint">Flint</persName> down.<anchor xml:id="n5"/> I would not have hurt his feelings for anything. He has been awfully
            nice to me.</p>
         <p>Write soon. Your letters are the greatest pleasure. You cannot think how I miss you and
            Hilda. <persName key="ada_russell">Mrs. Russell</persName> and I often talk about you. A good talk with you two would cheer me up. I
            feel so awfully down. Give my love to Hilda.</p>
         <closer>Yours ever.</closer>

               struggling financially because of the war. He proposes several solutions to aid de Gourmont, 
               including paying him for translations of his poetry Aldington has previously published, persuading 
               <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet Monroe</persName> to publish him in <title key="poetry" level="j">Poetry</title>, and getting him work at a newspaper. Aldington asks Lowell
