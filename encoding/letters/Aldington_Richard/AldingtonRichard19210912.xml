                        <p>This letter consists of 2 typed pages on carbon paper. The first page has
                            damage to the entire right edge, in which it is crumbling off. The
                            second page has some damage to the right edge as well. The second page
                            has a heading above the dateline (Mr. Aldington - 2). Preceding the
                            letter is a cheque for “<persName key="fs_flint">Flint</persName>,” in
                            which the front and back are scanned. </p>

                    <salute>Dear <persName>Richard</persName>:</salute></opener>
                    <p>Your letter of <date when="1921-08-26">August 26th</date> was very pleasant to get. My secretary did make a
                    mistake and forgot to enclose <persName key="fs_flint">Flint</persName>'s cheque, which you will find in this
                    letter. I am sorry for the blunder. We have all been very bust with <persName key="florence_ayscough">Mrs.
                    Ayscough</persName>'s and my <title key="firFlowerTablets" level="m">book of Chinese translations</title>, and I suppose that this draft
                    got left out somehow.</p>
                    <p>I am sorry about what you tell me of Flint, but perhaps he is only changing his
                    direction and becoming more interesting in his real work than in the literary
                    part of his life.</p>
                    <p>I feel much better after this last <rs key="medical" type="theme">operation</rs>, and have every hope of going to
                    <placeName key="england">England</placeName> <date when="1922">next Spring</date>.</p>
                    <p>Your letter is anything but cheerful. What is the matter with <persName key="ts_eliot">Eliot</persName>? I have no
                    idea he was ill. At least, however, England does give pensions to her own young
                    writers, and there are no such things of the kind here, except a few personal
                    prizes which individuals manage, and there are only about two of those.</p>
                    <p>I hear quite constantly from <persName key="dh_lawrence">Lawrence</persName>. He is getting a large public here in
                    <placeName key="usa">America</placeName>. How scattered all the contributors to <title key="someImagistPoets" level="m">our anthology</title> are, and how
                    diversely we are all developing! But that is as it should be, I think. If we
                    were not bigger than our theories, we should not be of much use.</p>
                    <p>I do not wonder that you found <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet Monroe</persName> difficult to work with. I find her
                    the same. I do not think you will miss much by not writing for “<title key="poetry" level="j">Poetry</title>.” Its
                    influence is not great. I suppose you are still working on the “<title key="londonTimes" level="j">Times</title>,” are you
                    not? You do not mention it in your letter.</p>
                    <p>This is a short note and, I fear, a dull one, because, after three<pb n="02"/> weeks of hard
                    work getting our Chinese book into the press, I am trying to do up my belated
                    mail, so I will not write more at the moment.</p>
                    <closer>Affectionately yours,</closer>
