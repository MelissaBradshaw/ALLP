                <salute>Dear <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>This last week has been hectic, with the <orgName key="houghton_mifflin">publishers</orgName> on one side and my knowledge of
                what you and <persName key="hilda_doolittle">Hilda</persName> and <persName key="fs_flint">Flint</persName> were feeling on the other. I have bankrupted myself on cables to
                ease the strain a little for you; and now that the thing is finished, I feel quite sure that you will all
                be thoroughly displeased with me. But after you have read this letter and reflected a little while, I
                think you will see that I have done the very best possible thing. Certainly I have tried to, and
                certainly I can do no more. It has got to go now, bad or good.</p>
            <p><persName key="ferris_greenslet">Mr. Greenslet</persName> was a good deal disturbed, as I wrote you, by our wish to change the title.
                “Imagiste” has come to have a certain meaning among lovers of poetry; and although <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra</persName> is
                known to have invented it, it has swung far beyond him and really become a word to designate a
                certain kind of poetry. For that reason it has a commercial value, as people interested in our sort
                of poetry know that they are getting it when they see the word “Imagiste” on the cover. Ezra
                knows that very well or he would not be so anxious to hang on to the word because, mind
                you, Ezra is thoroughly American in his understanding of the value of advertisement.</p>
            <p>Now, although I am paying for the printing of the <title key="some_imagist_poets" level="m">book</title>,<!-- This seemed like the first reasonable place to encode the title for the book that AL is referring to in the first three paragraphs, since it's the first time she mentions the "book" itself and not just titles that are in consideration. – VOD --> the publishers are paying for part
                of the advertising, and they naturally do not wish to lose any more than they can help. They
                accepted the book on the understanding that it would go out as Imagiste poetry, with the weight
                behind it which Imagiste poetry has got. Hence it was quite natural that Mr. Greenslet should be
                considerably disturbed at having this weight suddenly removed from the book. “The Six” meant
                nothing from the buyer’s point of view; “Some Twentieth Century Poets” was also indefinite, 
                as everybody is a twentieth century poet if you come to that, and it gave no suggestion as to what
                sort of poetry the book continued; it was neither a taking or an explaining title, and Mr. Greenslet
                just would not have it. “Some New Poets” seemed to him just as vague and rather less attractive.
                And there we stuck, he begging me not to change the title, and I assuring him that, although I
                personally never would have changed it, I was bound to do as you wished. If he had not been a
                very patient man and also devoted to our interests–quite crazy about us, in fact–I think that he
                would have thrown us over; but as it was, he worked just as hard as I did to try and find a title
                which would induce people to read the book and to which we should all agree. Suddenly he
                suggested “Quintessentialist.” He swears that that is what we really are, because we try to give
                the quintessence of a picture or an emotion without any obscuring ornamentation. So convinced
                of this was he that, in a review of my book which he is writing for “<title key="newRepublic" level="j">The New Republic</title>” and in
                which he discusses Imagism at some length, he says that he thinks a better title for us would be 
                “Quintessentialists,” as that would take in poems like your “Little Boy” which with Ezra’s
                narrow rules would hardly be called Imagist. I think it is not a bad name.</p>
            <p>In altering the preface, you will see that I have arranged it in such a manner as to show
                that we were simply taking another name because we are forced to; and we shall not force it
                down the public’s throat by way of advertisement in the manner of Vorticism. Also in the
                preface we are saying that we are not an exclusive artistic sect, which removes us from the
                charge of being another tu’penny ha’penny school.<anchor xml:id="n1"/> We simply take this name as a convenient
                shortening of all those tenets for which we stand.</p>
            <p>Mr. Greenslet is immensely enthusiastic over the name and says that, if we need any
                defense or writing up in the papers over here, he will do it for us. And as a great many of the
                reviews I have had have spoken slightly of Ezra and said how much better work I was doing and
                what a pity it was that such theories should be made ridiculous by him, I think people are ripe for
                a schism, and I think we shall be criticized most favorably and known as the members of the
                original movement who had anything real in them; while to make them understand that we are
                distinct from Ezra’s stuff and the people whom he will doubtless exploit from now on, we must
                have a convenient handle for them to call us by. That handle is supplied by Quintessentialist in
                good sound English, mind you, without this final “e” and if we are dignified and quiet and
                simple about the matter, I think it will not take long before the Quintessentialist movement is
                considered the most interesting and promising of the present day.</p>
            <p>I know your objections to isms and schools and fads, and we must not be an ism or a fad;
                and if reviewers choose to consider us a school, why let them. What we shall really be is a
                number of simple, quiet people, doing the best work we can along our own lines and gradually
                changing the point of view about poetry. Of that I am perfectly sure; and Mr. Greenslet, who is
                quite used to feeling the public pulse, is quite certain that our group shows more conclusively
                than anything else that poetic renaissance which is upon us.</p>
            <p>I have no wish to pose as the head of a new school, as Ezra will undoubtedly tell you. I
                have no doubt also that he will tell you that you are simply exchanging him for me, and that what
                I wanted all along was to rush myself into the position of leader. Search your hearts, you two,
                and I think you will see quite plainly that that has not been my object all along. I have striven for
                a perfect democracy. I have worked for the group ideal. This new <title key="swordBladesAndPoppySeed" level="m">book</title> of mine has placed me in
                a position where I can neither be hurt nor helped by any coadjutors, where my future is entirely
                up to me, and I can make it or mar it by my own efforts. But I do not want to make a success
                alone. I want us all to go together. As a group, I believe that we are invincible; and if Ezra tries
                to insinuate any such things as I have suggested, repudiate them in your own minds for they are
                not true.</p>
            <p>I have sent your manuscript in to Mr. Greenslet and left it in his charge. If he does not
                want it, he will take it back to you in <placeName key="london">London</placeName>, whither he sails on the sixth of February. He likes
                the poems in it very much, because he told me so; but whether he will print it or not I cannot say,
                although I am bound to tell you that I think he feels that too much of it is contained in other
                books to make it worth while to bring it out at this moment. I am giving him a letter to you
                Please be gentle with him and ‘roar him as gently as any sucking dove.’<anchor xml:id="n2"/> His opinions and yours
                will frequently not coincide. He likes many things that you repudiate. But he is earnest,
                teachable, and enthusiastic, and painfully shy, which he covers up by a dried-up, unsympathetic
                manner which was very difficult for me to get over at first. He will fight for us, work for us, push
                us! I am surprised myself at the interest he takes in us. He knows <persName key="ford_hueffer">Hueffer</persName> personally, and I think
                he said that he introduced Mr. and Mrs. Hueffer to each other. Be a little elastic with him, and do
                not propound your views too violently or too uncompromisingly. To get things into people’s
                heads, insinuation is better than clumping them over the cranium with a shilaly.<anchor xml:id="n3"/> We have got
                a jewel in Greenslet and a publishing medium of whom we may well be proud.</p>
            <p>I am glad now that <orgName key="macmillan">Macmillan</orgName> did not take the book, for they have very little knowledge
                of literature; and their publishing, though eminently satisfactory, is done more as a business than
                as an artistic pleasure. I think Greenslet with his new series has definitely taken his stand on our
                side, and I want you to like him, for I think that through him will come your best chance of your
                getting a berth in <placeName key="usa">America</placeName> when you want to come over and try it. He is all prepared to like you
                and Hilda and Flint immensely; and if you only won’t let yourself be too jarred by some of his
                predilections and get through the crust, you will find an honest, loyal, splendid fellow, who will
                help us in every possible way.</p>
            <p>I like your <persName key="clara_shanafelt">Clara Shanafelt</persName><anchor xml:id="n4"/> very much indeed, particularly the first and last. I will write
                her a letter when I have a little more time. I am rather sorry you could not cook up a little
                something nicer to say about <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet’s</persName> book.<anchor xml:id="n5"/> She called it a slam and felt it rather badly.
                Criticizing is a dreadful business: We must tell the truth, and yet it is a shame to quench the
                smoking flax. I thought you got out of it rather well, but Harriet saw through it quite clearly; and
                of course that doesn’t help us very much, as I am afraid Ezra still has her ear by his article on the
                <title key="spoonRiver" level="m">Spoon River Anthology</title>, which is her latest find. What do you think of the Spoon River Anthology 
                by the way? Personally I think I have worked out that this sort of poetry, which is not
                poetry at all, really has to be done in rhyme to get the tang into it; but given as it is, it might
                just as well be prose. But I won’t go into that now, it would lead me too far. Perhaps I will go into it
                in a review when the book comes out. Your <persName key="murial_chilkowski">Murial Chilkowski</persName><anchor xml:id="n6"/> is interesting, I think. You should
                like to send <measure type="currency" num="10">£10</measure> to “<title key="egoist" level="j">The Egoist</title>.” I had another letter from <persName key="harriet_weaver">Miss Weaver</persName> on the subject, but
                Ezra’s presence bothers me a little under the circumstances. It seems ridiculous to help support a
                thing when he is in it, continuing to swagger through its pages with his prejudices sticking out all
                over him like curl-papers. Your articles and those of the unpronounceable lady, whom I won’t
                attempt to spell again, and the poems, make the paper of value to me. Tell me what you think
                about the <measure type="currency" num="10">£10?</measure></p>
            <p>To-morrow I begin to rehearse six hours a day until my operettas are over.<anchor xml:id="n7"/> I am
                awfully tired now, and I must say the change of title of the Anthology has given me no end of
                trouble. It was no easy matter to make them set up their folder all over again when they got it
                into print. I am tired, Richard, so tired that I wonder some times whether I am to get through the
                winter without breaking down; and even if you don’t like the name, please be considerate about
                it, for there is absolutely nothing more I can do, and we shall just have to give it up entirely if we
                cannot agree on this. I am having a hard time with Harriet too, about getting all our poems
                printed in time. It has been no joke, running this Anthology, has it? But I think we shall be glad
                of it in the end.</p>
            <closer>Love to you both,</closer>
