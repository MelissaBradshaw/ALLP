         <p>Here is our bi-yearly pittance from the <title key="someImagistPoets" level="m">Imagist Anthologies</title>. It gets smaller and smaller but never seems to stop entirely. However, as they have only a few copies on hand of each year and we have long ago given orders not to reprint, I think any time it may cease altogether.</p>

         <p>I took the liberty of giving a letter to you to a young friend of mine the other day. His name is <persName key="royall_snow">Royall Snow</persName>, and he is one of the Rhodes scholars. He has just sailed for <placeName key="england">England</placeName>, and was to do a little tripping round the <placeName key="europe">continent</placeName> before he settled at <orgName key="oxford">Oxford</orgName>. He will probably present his letter some time during the <date when="1923">Winter</date>. He writes poetry and prose; his interest is in creation; his faculty is for criticism. I have never been able to see much in his poems, but don't tell him I said so. He is now writing a novel, I believe. His criticism is really good and has appeared in the <title key="newRepublic" level="j">“New Republic”</title> and elsewhere. He was very anxious to meet you because he admires you very much, and I thought you would not object to my giving him a letter. He is a most highly educated young person, having graduated <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="underline">summa cum laude</hi></foreign> from <orgName key="harvard">Harvard</orgName>, and he has been teaching in universities for the two years since he has left college. Last year he was assistant professor of English at <orgName key="dalhousieUniversity">Dalhousie University</orgName>, <placeName key="halifax">Halifax</placeName>.</p>
         <p>This reminds me of <persName key="ts_eliot">Eliot</persName> and your request. I am awfully sorry, dear Richard, I know just how you must hate me, but I cannot like your new <pb n="02"/>plan even as well as I liked your old. I regard it as a strategic blunder, and I cannot help thinking that you will do Mr. Eliot more harm than good in the eyes of the public; therefore, I still feel that I cannot go in with you. I may be wrong, I may bitterly regret it in the future, I may change my mind, but that is the way I feel about it now.</p>
