                <salute>Dear <persName key="richard_aldington">Richard</persName>:</salute></opener>
            <p>I have a lot of letters to answer and also one of <persName key="hilda_doolittle">Hilda's</persName>. I have been waiting to hear from
                you about the Anthology because, to tell the truth, I had not the heart to write until I knew what
                you would decree its fate to be. I have set my heart on our little group publishing together so
                strongly that it was almost more than I could bear to think that it might fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>Now I have really quite good news for you. I think <persName key="ferris_greenslet">Mr. Greenslet</persName> is slowly wheeling
                round, although it is quite clear that he will not wheel fast enough to publish “<title key="heaven" level="a">Heaven</title>” in this
                year’s number of the Anthology; still, I think that with gentle handling he will put it into some
                other year. I told him what you had said in your letter, or rather a paraphrase of it, and he begged
                me to tell you that he liked “Heaven.” It was a mere commercial attitude which kept him from
                putting it in the first number. He felt that the public would be prejudiced against us all, and that
                he wished to avoid; but when I suggested that it might be put into one of the later parts, he quite
                agreed that it might; so I think that a little patience and tact on our parts will bring the whole
                thing out right in time. It is also true that the head of his firm is a perfectly unliterary, very
                conventional, and stupid man, and I think Mr. Greenslet didn’t wish to have him come down on
                the whole scheme like a cartload of bricks on account of that poem. I know <persName key="george_mifflin">Mr. Mifflin</persName> myself,
                and I think it very likely would have caused him to stop the whole arrangement; but after we
                have made a success with our first volume, a <u><foreign xml:lang="fr">success d’estime</foreign></u>, even if not a commercial success,
                I believe he will let us put in pretty much what we like next year and the year after, for the
                contract is to be made out for three years.</p> <!-- Missy has Ford Madox Hueffer listed in the "people mentioned" for this letter, but his name isn't mentioned and I couldn't find a pronoun that seemed to be specifically referring to Hueffer. I was thinking if there was one, it would be in this paragraph since AL is talking about Hueffer's poem "Heaven." LMK if I'm missing something! I went through with a pretty fine tooth comb. Same goes for "Houghton Mifflin" the publisher versus Mr. Mifflin the person. I couldn't make out a specific pronoun that might be referring to the publisher rather than the person, but Missy also has "Houghton Mifflin" listed as a publisher in this letter. – VOD -->
            <p>Unfortunately, I have to pay for the printing of the book, and for whatever advertising
                may seem advisable outside of their advertising for the whole series, which they will do at their
                expense. This I am very glad to do as my contribution towards our group. If there are any assets
                from the sales, I will divide them in equal parts and send them to all of us.<anchor xml:id="n1"/></p> <!-- Not sure how we want to encode this kind of transaction. – VOD -->
            <p>The book is to be called “<title key="some_imagist_poets" level="m">Some Imagist Poets</title>,” as we decided. I have no wish to drop the
                name, and neither has Ferris Greenslet, although I warned him of <persName key="ezra_pound">Ezra’s</persName> possible behavior. I told
                him of the letters Ezra wrote <orgName key="macmillan">Macmillan</orgName>, although I did not tell him that we had offered this book
                to Macmillan. He replied that he didn’t care in the least what Ezra might do, that he was quite
                used to that sort of thing, that he knew Ezra personally, and understood the whole situation. In
                this he differs very much from Macmillan, as neither <persName key="george_brett">Col. Brett</persName>, the head of the firm, nor 
                <persName key="ec_marsh">Mr. Marsh</persName>, his lieutenant, are in the least personally acquainted with any of the younger men nor
                their works, except in a perfectly superficial way. I think the real reason that Brett refused to
                have anything to do with the Anthology was more because he has been over-reaching himself on 
                poetry the last few years than because of Ezra’s letters, although Ezra’s letters undoubtedly
                pushed the balancing pendulum entirely over.</p>
            <p>Greenslet, on the other hand, feels that Brett has been getting ahead of him in the matter
                of the younger poets and is anxious to get back and show himself an up-to-date, go-ahead
                publisher. Therefore I think we have nothing to fear on that score.</p>
            <p>The contract is not signed yet, because it takes some little time to draw it up; but I have a
                letter from Greenslet agreeing to publish the volume if “<title key="heaven" level="a">Heaven</title>” was taken out; and as
                “Heaven” has been taken out, his letter would hold him even without any contract.
                Besides, he isa perfectly honest man, the most honest publisher in <placeName key="usa">America</placeName>, I firmly believe; 
                and therefore the contract is as good as signed already</p>
            <p>As to your saying to Ezra that we hoped he would come in later—that I have simply got
                to decline. You can see yourself that, after the way Ezra has treated me, it would be extremely
                undignified and weak for me to admit him into a venture which I was financing. That it might be
                possible for Ezra to apologize and show himself so sincerely sorry as to make the situation
                possible, I do not deny; but I cannot imagine that’s happening; and unless it does, I am afraid I
                must refuse to have anything to do with Ezra in anything which I happen to have a finger in. I am
                sorry for him, for I know his day is over and ours has just begun; but he did it himself and did it
                maliciously, and there is nothing whatever which I could do to alter it that I did not try to do
                while I was in <placeName key="london">London</placeName>. His behavior since has knocked him completely out of any of my
                schemes. Therefore, although I have left our tribute to him in the preface, I have taken out the
                paragraph saying that we hoped he might contribute in future.</p>
            <p>Now as to your own book<anchor xml:id="n2"/>–it was not Ferris Greenslet who refused it; it was I who didn’t
                give it to him. My reasons for doing so were purely commercial: it seemed to me a mistake
                for you to publish this volume just now. Out of the twenty-six original poems in this volume, ten
                were in the first Imagiste Anthology, and six in the new one, the seventh being your “Faun
                Seeing Snow for the First Time” which doesn’t seem to be in this book at all. That leaves only
                ten original poems which would make the public care to buy this book rather than the others. It
                seemed to me that to have a number of volumes in which your poems appear all coming out very
                close together; was an error of judgment. A good deal of these volumes are translations, which I
                don’t think ever have as much attraction as a volume of original work. If you had written them
                alone, merely as translations, they would go along as that; but put with original work they must
                necessarily take a second place. It seemed to me, therefore, that it would be better to publish the
                volume next autumn, when it would not conflict with our new Anthology nor with the old one,
                which is being extensively advertised by the <orgName key="boniLiveright">Boni’s</orgName>, who are pushing all their old stuff, not
                having capital enough to accept any new.</p>
            <p>I asked Ferris Greenslet whether he would be willing to take a volume of your poems. He
                said yes, he thought he would; and if you would like to have him do so, I will hand him this
                book, and perhaps it would be well to give it to him anyway and see what he thinks of it. That I
                will do; but I can’t help thinking that it would be well to delay publication until the new
                Anthology is out and has been on sale for at least six months.</p>
            <p>Ferris Greenslet is going over to London in the middle of January, and I will give him a
                letter to you, and you can talk to him. If he takes your book, the offer from the London publisher
                will not matter to him, as <orgName key="constable">Constable</orgName> are their agents and the whole series will go
                through them. So much for that business!</p>
            <p>Now let me thank you very much for the two letters of <persName key="remy_gourmont">Remy de Gourmont</persName> which you
                sent me. I shall be delighted to have one of his volumes with a dedication, and even more
                delighted if I might have some of his manuscripts, as you suggest. What would please me more
                than anything else, but what I feel would now be impossible, would be to have you send him a
                copy of my book and get him to honestly tell me what he thinks of it. But I am afraid that is
                unfeasible: in the first place, because he might not be willing to be brutally honest to me under
                the circumstances, and also because I fear he is too ill to turn his mind to such a task at present,
                and thirdly because I fear it might look as though I had some such ideas in my head when I sent
                him the money. Therefore, that is quite out of the question, although his criticism would have
                been of the utmost value to me.</p>
            <p>Now I am bound to tell you that I was awfully disappointed in that first article of his.
                Richard let us be honest–there really wasn’t a damned thing in it that any tyro could not have
                written. I am sorry you told him what I said about Gallicisms, for Frenchmen are so strangely
                constructed that, if they are told to be careful what they write, they never can write anything at
                all of interest. They seem to feel this prohibition weighing on them like a shackle, even in
                subjects where, left to themselves, they would have no temptation to break it. It is either this or
                because M. de Gourmont regards Americans as in the kindergarten class that he writes such a
                singularly elementary little paper. Now “<title key="newRepublic" level="j">The New Republic</title>” is not an elementary paper,
                certainly has no intention of being one, and I don’t think a mere statement of facts which can be
                got out of any newspaper will seem to them worth the price they are paying. It would not,
                therefore, surprise me very much if <persName key="herbert_croly">Mr. Croly</persName> returned this article, with a request for something
                a little more thoughtful. I have given him your address and suggested that he communicate
                directly with you, send you the money for M. de Gourmont etc. I have also told him that, if he
                prefers to do the business through me, as heretofore, I shall be delighted to have him do so. But I
                imagine he will write to you directly. And if he should refuse this article, don’t be discouraged
                and don’t let M. de Gourmont be discouraged. Only suggest to him to write as though for a
                French review. Should anything prohibitive crop up in his articles, you could easily delete it in
                the translation.</p>
            <p>Now, Richard, here’s another thing–please don’t be hurt with me, if I say to you to be
                jolly careful about your translation. M. de Gourmont’s style is so essential a part of his greatness
                that in translating him you ought to make a special effort to retain its perfume. That is the great
                difficulty in translating: to keep the aroma of the original. I don’t think you have quite done that
                in this article; so do be awfully careful in future, for if M. de Gourmont is to make a public here
                and if “The New Republic” are to be sponsor for him before the American people, he ought to
                have every chance of getting himself over, and not a mere emasculated edition of himself. Of
                course, I have not read the original of this article, and it may very well be that it is just as
                uncharacteristic in manner as in matter; but I have read other of your translations before, and I do
                think that this has been their fault. They seem to me translations—just bad translations—and you
                translate Henri de Renier into the same English that you translate Remy de Gourmont. Therefore,
                forgive me if I say “Be careful,” because not only is it not fair to your author not to give the
                whole of him but it defeats your object of “getting over” as the actors say. Please don’t mind my
                saying this; you know I do it with the best will in the world.</p>
            <p>Now I want to thank you for your nice, long article on me in the “<title key="egoist" level="j">Egoist</title>.”<anchor xml:id="n3"/> I was not in the
                least angry. In the main, I was most sincerely pleased and surprised, for I never thought to hear
                such genuinely sympathetic praise from you; and it means more to me to please you than I can
                say. And Hilda’s letter makes me realize how splendidly you are working in my behalf, and I am
                immensely happy that it should be so. I am not at all surprised that you do not like some of the
                poems, particularly the long, narrative poems in stanzas. I knew you wouldn’t like them; and
                when I tell you that I have just written another, I am quite sure you will tear your hair and howl
                with rage. But I seem unable to confine myself to one style; I must write in many, according as
                the mood seizes me. I must work out my own destiny; and you know quite well that it is at least
                not the destiny of weakness nor ignorance, so forgive me if I ‘gang my ane gait’<anchor xml:id="n4"/> and write the
                things you hate as well as the things you like. The only squeal I could make as to your criticism
                is that when you said “<title key="maxBreuck">Max Breuck</title>” <!-- Missy has both the poem title and the work it's published in (SBPS) listed in the metadata spreadsheet. I couldn't find a reference to the collection in addition to the poem. LMK if I'm missing something! – VOD --> 
                and the others were false in cadence, I think you might have
                added, in fairness to me, that you considered everything false in cadence which was written in
                regular meters. It sounded as if I were writing false meter when I tried for regular meters; and
                that, you know, is not the case. I am sincerely glad you said just what you thought: the bad and
                the good; it is exactly what I want and what I hope you will always do. And I am awfully glad
                you like those <persName key="paul_fort">Paul Fort</persName> meters. <persName key="john_fletcher">Fletcher</persName> has christened them “polyphonic” prose, which I think
                an excellent name; for as you and I know, although Paul Fort gave me the idea, they are written
                on a somewhat different scheme from Paul Fort’s and based on a different rhythm, the rhythm of
                <u><foreign xml:lang="fr">vers libre</foreign></u> in fact, instead of the Alexandrine. Fletcher has written an article upon them, which
                <persName key="harriet_monroe">Harriet</persName> has accepted for “<title key="poetry" level="j">Poetry</title>” <!-- Harriet Monroe and "Poetry" weren't listed in the metadata spreadsheet, but I added them in since that seemed appropriate! – VOD -->
                and he is trying them himself now; so that we stand a very
                good chance, with yours and his and my attempts, of doing something which Ezra can not claim
                in the slightest degree, and which in self-defense he will probably heartily and violently
                condemn.</p>
            <p>Fletcher was here for a week, and most delightful companion he was. He likes the place
                and I hope he may come back to <placeName key="boston">Boston</placeName> while he is getting his book through the press. He is
                ever so much improved, a thoroughly nice fellow when you know him well. I have become very
                fond of him.</p>
            <p>I enclose a programme of a reading we had here last week. We all gave our services for
                the Belgians. Hans Ebell is a travelling pianist a pupil of the conservatory of Cracow. The other
                two participants you know. I read three poems under each heading, five under “Images,” and I
                ended up with “<title key="bombardment" level="a">The Bombardment</title>.” My composer friend, <persName key="carl_engel">Carl Engel</persName>, did the booms on a big
                bass drum, concealed from the audience, as my voice wouldn’t carry them with any effect. I was
                afraid it might seem a little too futuristic, but it didn’t—the audience of about four hundred
                people took it as seriously as it was meant, and it had an immense success. I have an idea of
                repeating it in <placeName key="chicago">Chicago</placeName> when I go out there. I wish you had been here. That audience would have
                given you the most deliciously warm feeling at your heart. They were as enthusiastic as they
                could be, and a lot of them came round afterwards and told me what they felt about it–people I
                didn’t know. I do believe there is a great hope in the American public, if we all stick together and
                whack at it. I am to talk on Saturday before the <orgName key="twentiethCenturyClub">Twentieth Century Club</orgName>, a learned society here,
                on “The Failure of American Poetry and the Remedy.” I am scared to death, but I think it is an
                opportunity</p>
            <p>Well, dear Richard and Hilda, this is an unconscionably long letter, and I will stop it
                in a moment and write again when I have taken the book in to Ferris Greenslet.</p>
            <p>Lots of love, and I hope Christmas and the New Year will bring you only happiness, and
                the end of the war for us all. <persName key="ada_russell">Mrs. Russell</persName> joins me in sending a great deal of love to you both.</p>
            <closer>Very sincerely yours,</closer>

                <note target="#n1" resp="mb">Edward C. Marsh outlines the financial arrangement Lowell made for her books’ publication when she moved from Houghton-Mifflin to Macmillan, where she fronted the cost of publication in return for 85% of the profits. : “We are quite prepared to accept the terms of publication which you suggest, i.e., that you shall bear the expense of publication and receive all the returns less our usual commission of 15%” (Edward Marsh to Amy Lowell, February 18, 1914, MS Lowell 19 [813]). With the three volumes of Some Imagist Poets (Houghton Mifflin, 1915, 1916, 1917) Lowell splits those profits between herself, Aldington, H.D., John Gould Fletcher, F.S. Flint, and D.H. Lawrence.</note>

Lowell encourages Ferris Greenslet to publish this book after all, the following month, although she has not changed her mind about her misgivings about the volume, which she outlines in her letter to Greenslet (Amy Lowell to Ferris Greenslet, January 13, 1915).
